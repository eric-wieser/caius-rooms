                "Best Features": "It has great character. Both the windows are inset, the living room window having a great view over the towers of Caius, Great St Mary's and King's Chapel if you ignore the St Mary's accommodation. The fact that it is almost entirely self contained is also a big plus: it feels very homely, and can be a great place to relax as well as a good, quiet place to work. And I can't express how nice it is to have your own fridge.",
                "Furniture": "The living room has a fairly average-sized, quite ugly Caius desk, with two bookshelves, a chest of drawers, a coffee table and two chairs of the same nature. The fridge is also in the living room. There is quite enough room for additions: I have a covered clothes rail in one corner, which is very useful as there is only one, single built-in wardrobe otherwise, which is in the bedroom. In this smaller room there is also a bed, another chair which used to be in the living room but is more ugly and less comfortable than the other two, a medicine cabinet, a bedside table, and the washbasin.",
                "General": "The one thing that isn't so much to do with the room but is really quite unpleasant is that the bedder, who is otherwise very efficient, smokes in the toilet. The other thing that's worth noting is that all the furniture is very average, and typically Caius-ian - the room benefits hugely from some careful dressing and nice soft furnishings. One last thing - it is up six flights of stairs, but I always think that it partly compensates for the rather sedentary lifestyle that is the consequence of living in the centre of town.",
                "Gyp Room": "This room has its own gyp room, which is really exciting in that you have your own fridge...but less exciting in that you only have one hob, and no matter how carefully you apply the term \"bijou\", the fact is that there are wardrobes bigger than the room itself, and it therefore has very little worktop space. That said, the hob is gas, and therefore much more efficient than the average Caius cooking equipment, and despite the size of the room it has a fair amount of storage space.",

                "Worst Features": "If you like having lots of people round, it can get a bit crowded in the living room, as it is quite narrow - it's not really suitable for parties. It is also quite drafty, although the gothic sound-effects are quite charming in their own way, but surprisingly the windows are quite difficult to open and close, despite being so charming. Also, don't sit on the edge of the bed with the medicine cabinet door open.",

In the bedroom, there is a bed, a bedside table, a chest of drawers, a small built-in wardrobe, a sink, and a mirror over the sink.",

Also the room is large enough and centre enough so that gatherings with friends are very convenient and everyone has enough space to relax and chat. Would definitely recommend bringing your own desk lamp as the one provided is quite weak and is more appropriate as a beside lamp. I love this room and would've given it an 8 but the noise might be unbearable for those who sleep lightly, so shall give it a 7 instead.",

A newly redone worktop and a lot of drawers for storage. Although it is much recommended that you keep utensils and snacks in your room as they tend to be nicked...",
                "Heating": "One electric heater in the living room and one in the bedroom, plus one portable heater \"on wheels\". The new electric heater may take a while to warm the sizable living room up, but can keep the room nice and warm once you leave it for 10-15 minutes. The bedroom heater is a bit weak and doesn't do much except dry the towels / washing, so definitely recommend the portable heater on cold days. (Hint: if you turn the portable heater on and leave it in between the living room and the bedroom, the whole set will become warm and fuzzy.)",

The bedroom can sometimes be a bit dim especially when it is cloudy, but doesn't matter really when you have the lights on.",
                "Noise Level": "There is double glazing on all the windows, so most of the noise from Market Square during the day is blocked out. Weekends tend to be a lot noisier with street performances right under the bedroom window, so you will hear \"Tears in Heaven\" at least played 3 times a day, and maybe the occasional choir singing Christmas carols during the festive season. This room is the room which is closest to the Trailer of Life, so noise during the early hours in the morning may be a bit distracting, although it has improved since the city council demanded it to be closed earlier. However, it doesn't stop drunk people in Market Square or Rose Crescent (to and from McD and Gardies) being loud and disruptive to sleep / the late-night essay. Protests are the worst, although they only happen occasionally. Also, thinking about it, the Christmas Lights ceremony can either be a lovely festival or a nuisance since you can hear everything even with the double glazing tightly shut.",

                "Bathroom": "2 showers right next to the room that work very well. There are two toilet cubicle things opposite the Gyp room, again nice and near your room.",
                "Best Features": "I'm a fan of the built in wardrobe and desk, they give me some stability in my life, as well as lending the room some much needed character. The desk is a great size too. It's a good room if you're after the quiet life, due to it's out of the way location. Showers and heating are a positive too, as is the lovely view of Triniy and John's Chapel.",
                "Furniture": "List of furniture: Bedside cabinet with little cupboard and drawer, bed, bookshelf, coffee table, chest-of-drawers (4 drawers), 'comfy' chair, desk chair that's more comfortable than the aforementioned armchair and a noticeboard. The defining feature of this room is the built-in wardrobe and desk at the end. I personally like the desk, which is a good size, and the wardrobe is spacious, with three big drawers useful for storage. The right hand half of said wardrobe contains a mirror and a sink, as well as a towel rack. Oh and there's an overhead storage compartment at the top that I thought was locked, but it isn't and is very useful. Worth noting that I had an electric piano and piano stool in my room, so you might get more furniture than I did.",
                "General": "I believe there are six sockets in the room, and the Ethernet port is in a surprisingly sensible place for a Caius room. I've personally liked living here this year, it's got a nice view, good facilities and a bit of character. However you will quickly grow to hate the stairs, and the walls could do with a lick of paint in places. It's an excellent room though, particularly for a 2nd year.",
                "Gyp Room": "Reasonable size, standard Caius equipment of Microwave,  G-F, kettle etc. However the fridge is on the small side given that 6 people use it, so be prepared to fight for space.",
                "Heating": "Never had any problems with the heating, radiator is behind the desk so will keep your feet warm whilst you work.",
                "Natural Lighting": "Plentiful. Less good after sunset.",
                "Noise Level": "It's quiet, although the walls are pretty thin and the person immediately below you can apparently hear everything you say. So say only nice things.",
                "Worst Features": "The stairs. Going up the stairs towards hall, then two flights of steep stone spiral stairs several times a day is a huge pain in the legs, as well as slightly negating the advantage of a central location. It also turns moving in and out into some kind of mountaineering challenge. Worth noting that it is one of the smaller rooms in F staircase, and the corridor very occasionally will smell of Caius hall. Which is not ideal.",

                "Bathroom": "There are 2 toilets (cubicles like school loos) about a minute from the room and 2 showers about 30 seconds from the room \u00c2\u2013 such a bonus. Six people on corridor so 3 people to each facility. \nShowers are fine \u00c2\u2013 quite small but both quite powerful and so close to room \u00c2\u2013 no complaints.\nLoos are also fine. If they get skanky you can always use the ones on the floor below or even the ones in the undercroft.",
                "Best Features": "Location \u00c2\u2013 being right in the centre of town is brilliant. Gonville Court is lovely, it\u00c2\u2019s the oldest part of College, and you really feel like part of the College living here. The room is near hall, it\u00c2\u2019s near the bar, it\u00c2\u2019s just quite convenient. This is a really nice corridor.\nSink in wardrobe - honestly, it\u00c2\u2019s really handy!",
                "Furniture": "How I love my giant built-in wardrobe! Right hand side is for clothes, left hand side is a sink (woop!). The sink is an excellent feature and has a big mirror with a cupboard behind it, great to be able to close the wardrobe door and hide the sink away. Never had problems with sink blocking up in this room.  Also two towel handles on inside of wardrobe door. There are two drawers under the left hand side of wardrobe and a giant drawer under the sink-hand side of the wardrobe. \nDesk is built in, it\u00c2\u2019s not massive, and you have to climb on to it to open/close the window, but it\u00c2\u2019s absolutely fine, I\u00c2\u2019m an arts student and there\u00c2\u2019s enough room for my books, printer and laptop (plus general mess!)\nOther things: two big ol\u00c2\u2019 comfy chairs and desk chair; big bookshelf; chest of drawers (4); bedside table with drawer and cupboard bit; lamp; coffee table; bed (obviously!)",
                "General": "I have been lucky enough to live in this room in my second year (was around middle of the ballot I think) and I would definitely recommend living here to either second or third years. I\u00c2\u2019ve loved living in such an old part of college; walking down the worn spiral stairs and through the courts on the way to lectures everyday is really special and you feel like a real Cambridge student!  And the view from the window (of Trinity) is nice if you crane your neck a bit. There tends to be a mix of second and third years, which makes living here a good way to meet people in different year groups. The location is fantastic. It\u00c2\u2019s also safe and secure and as it\u00c2\u2019s near hall it\u00c2\u2019s easy for people to visit and the bar is just downstairs. The size of the room is good, it\u00c2\u2019s not the biggest on the corridor but not the smallest either, and the furniture is in good condition. Being so close to the showers, loos and gyp room is a plus, as is the fact that only a few people share these facilities. The porter\u00c2\u2019s never really come up here and going through the Lodge (even after a night out) is fine.",
                "Gyp Room": "Gyp room is good \u00c2\u2013 a fair size for Old Courts and has all the Caius cooking essentials (two microwaves, new George Forman, kettle, toaster). Nice view out towards the library and across the city if you crane your neck. Everyone has a cupboard although these don\u00c2\u2019t lock.",
                "Heating": "Radiator is under the desk and by the window, so the heat tends to escape out the window. Having said this, room is almost always really warm. The window is single glazed so does let the cold in a bit on a super-cold day, no-where near as bad as I thought it might be, easily solved by bringing a warm blanket up. Windows open fine, easy to air the room. \nTends to get hot during Hall and the corridor outside is always boiling.",
                "Natural Lighting": "I was worried the room would be dark but have been surprised at how light it is even with the Trinity battlement right outside the window. Even when it\u00c2\u2019s a bit darker in winter putting on the main light and/or lamp easily gives you enough light.",
                "Noise Level": "Took me a while to work out that the weird glass noise was Trinity tipping out their (numerous) alcohol vessels out really early in the morning but you get used to it and it\u00c2\u2019s not a problem! On the whole this is an extremely quiet corridor \u00c2\u2013 lovely people live here this year \u00c2\u2013 but it\u00c2\u2019s not a social hub! Can\u00c2\u2019t hear a thing from Hall (even during events like BCD) and on that note there are no food smells from hall either. There is occasional noise from the street but it\u00c2\u2019s pretty minimal (the room is very high up).",
                "Worst Features": "The stairs \u00c2\u2013 this room is up two flights of spiral stairs plus the first set of stairs up to hall. Makes moving in pretty tricky (especially as this is in the furthest court too). Generally though you get used to them and you definitely feel like you\u00c2\u2019re at an old College!\nPersonally, I find it a bit too quiet but that\u00c2\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing.",

If you have a really good friend that you'd like to share with and are fairly sociable this room is perfect and I'd give it 10/10 (the other bedroom's not quite as good but still 9/10). If you're a bit of a loner, value your privacy above anything else and/or always work in your room and hate distractions then this is not the room for you. \nOur bedder is fab, carpet and decor inoffensive, the room is warm because it has a fire and there are plenty of plugs, in fact there are millions.\nFeel free to pop round to have a look, there's usually someone in, especially at 1.45 when neighbours starts!",

                "Best Features": "Location is obviously great, and it's a lot bigger than it looks from the photos -- no problems hosting up to 10 people if needed. The sofa is good. The view over St Mike's is nice.",
                "Furniture": "Standard stuff. There's also one reasonably comfortable armchair and a sofa (seats maximum 3), which has definitely seen some difficult times. I'd recommend bringing a throw.",
                "General": "You'll probably need a multiple extension lead as there are only six (I think) power sockets in the room, and four of them are awkwardly located. Overall this is a really nice room if you're pretty high up on the second-year ballot (I was around 25th) \u00e2\u00c2\u20ac\u00c2\u201c if you\u00e2\u00c2\u20ac\u00c2\u2122re a third year, you can probably do better with a room in St Mike's. This is one of the nicer rooms in St Mary\u00e2\u00c2\u20ac\u00c2\u2122s though.",
                "Gyp Room": "The kitchen is a little bit down the corridor, and you'll probably end up sharing with 3-4 other people. Fridge space isn't brilliant -- there are two small fridges in the kitchen (and no freezer facilities, which is fairly standard at Caius). This might be because our kitchen is slightly oversubscribed this year -- there's another one further down the corridor that more people should be using. I was also shocked to find that there were no hobs or ovens either, but it\u00e2\u00c2\u20ac\u00c2\u2122s probably better that way because we can\u00e2\u00c2\u20ac\u00c2\u2122t start fires or get crushed by falling ovens and all the other scary things that happen when you try to cook for yourself.",
                "Heating": "The radiator works fine and I've never really been very cold in here. No complaints.",
                "Natural Lighting": "Pretty well lit in winter mornings, though I can't speak to how this changes during the day as I'm very rarely in my room. Also not sure how well lit it is in Easter term, though I can't imagine this will be an issue.",
                "Noise Level": "I'm going to disagree with previous reviews -- it's pretty noisy if you're a light sleeper, as one of the windows faces out almost onto Trinity Street. Besides, there can be a lot of noise from St Mike's itself. I've had to invest in some earplugs so that I can stay asleep after 7am.",
                "Worst Features": "Noise due to single glazing. Probably the worst feature, however, is a highly suspicious and sometimes quite oppressive stain on the cork board.",

Tiny toilet, room with sink and shower room with lots of character just round the corner from the room, shared with 7-8 others, however the floor below has two more (much nicer and more spacious) showers and three more toilets and bathrooms within a few seconds walk of the room, so you can just use those - there end up being more than enough to go round.",
                "Best Features": "The decent size, the location right in the middle of town, the amazing sofa, the quiet, the look of jealousy on your friends faces when they see your sofa.",
                "Furniture": "One amazingly comfortable sofa! Genuinely much more comfortable than the bed, you will be the envy of everyone else with this sofa. Standard alright bed, decent desk, reasonably good armchair, old swivel desk chair. The wardrobe is a bit small but also has lots of useful shelves in it. The bookshelf is really large and can store plenty of stuff, the chest of drawers has lots of space. If you run out of chairs there is a supervision room next door which has stacks of plastic chairs you can borrow. The lighting provided is alright, but you should bring extra lamps if you want to make the room really well lit. Oh, and there is a large fridge in the room, which is an added bonus, although I wouldn't be surprised if college chooses to remove it, it's hugely extravagant! I think there are two or three sets of sockets, you will need extension leads or four ways.",
                "General": "This staircase contains lots of guest rooms, so you will have strangers walking past your room nearly every day. The room next to this is a supervision room, I was out all day so this wasn't an issue, but if you like to work in your room this may be a problem. I'm unsure how much the bedder actually ever cleans the room, but she does do the washing up sometimes, which makes up for it. The staircase is a maze, this room is on the second floor and is fairly easy to access, just go up the stairs twice and you are there.",
                "Gyp Room": "Okay gyp room just round the corner, shared with about 4 or 5, but never really had too many space problems. There's another nicer gyp room further down the corridor which you can use if you so desire.",
                "Heating": "Can get pretty cold - in part this is because the windows are single glazed and the room has two external walls, the room is noticeably colder than the other rooms on the corridor. However, this may have been because my radiator was broken - it is now fixed, although it doesn't output a huge amount of heat even now. Bring an extra blanket and you'll be fine.",
                "Natural Lighting": "Not brilliant - the main window faces south east and gets sunlight in the morning, however G St. Mikes blocks the light until the sun gets over it, so you get direct sunlight only for a short period of time. However, you get lots of reflected diffuse light the rest of the day, so the room is never too dark. I should mention that I am writing this review in March, I suspect the light will be much better during Easter Term.",

                "General": "IMPORTANT General Comment: In Feb 2010, I wrote a pretty bad review of this room. That wasn't really an accurate assessment. I actually really liked this room, although the negatives do still apply, they really don't bother you too much. It was great for entertaining, with the sofa and is fairly large. It gets lots of morning sun, which helps when trying to get up for lectures. It is a bit separate from the rest of the corridor, which means people don't tend to stand and talk outside your door, which is nice. It is significantly quieter than other rooms on the staircase which face out towards the street, I was never woken by noises from Trinity Street, so if you're concerned about noise but want to live in St Mary's this is the one to go for. Lovely fireplace with a mirror hanging over it, which was handy and looked great with a nice vase of flowers. I enjoyed my year here and I hope you do too if you get it :)",

                "Best Features": "The room is big, light, and has nice furniture, close to facilities, looks into St. Mikes so is quiet, lots of storage space from cupboards in the walls. It has a homely feel to it. Also - you can get Lapwing.",

Also lots of cupboards in the walls with shelves in them, and shelves on the walls too which are handy for putting books etc. Decent sized desk. Coffee table",
                "General": "Lots of sockets. The skylight didn't have a blind when I first moved in which was so annoying when you wanted a lie in - asked college to put a blind on it. They did this but the blind is shit and covers the window frame, not the window, so if you open the window it knocks the blind straight off. You may have to battle with housekeeping to get them to replace it with a blind that is actually right for the window, I doubt they'll get round to it in my time! Generally though, this is a really nice room - you don't have anyone above, below or to the side of you so it's also really quiet/ you don't feel bad about playing music loud. K St. Mary's is a bit of a mental building though so bare that in mind. If you are fussy about toilets, you may find it hard.",

It has plenty of furniture, the highlights being the full length mirror, the extra cupboards in the walls (great for storing stuff during the holidays) and has a great view into St Mike's court.

Shared by everyone in the staircase (10 people). Slightly annoying when you go upstairs and the shower is in use, so you have to get back down and wait and hope no one else from the other floors are waiting and get there before you! But the shower is a very good one (it isn't dripping like the ones in Morti Road, or only ever boiling hot like the ones in A Block Harvey Court). But as there are fellows living in the staircase too (in a seperate area), I had the experience of bumping into a fellow (in all his gowns etc returning from a Feast) after I just had a shower!",
                "Best Features": "Very well heated up. The small size is a good thing because the room feels cosy once you've personalised it. Being in the centre of town, near college, near the library. (People from New Hall or something are very jealous of the location of my room!) Very useful if you have something to do in college early in the morning. Whenever I bought too much stuff to carry I can just pop back, drop them off and carry on!

It is possible to swing a hamster along the width, but I wouldn't do it since it will smash into the mounted shelves. \n\nThe bedder is really nice and sociable, cleans properly and is very helpful. There isn't enough sunlight in the room even on a sunny day. There are only 3 sockets in the room. The wardrobe is just big enough for me now (it is threatening to fall apart). The rent (including internet) is pretty low.",

So noise-wise (from the street), it's not too bad during daytime. But then I rarely work in my room during daytime. As the window directly faces a wall of the little alley next to Paperchase, sometimes there are underage school kids drinking and swearing out loud in that alley in the afternoon. Nighttime: Noise can be pretty bad (think drunks) especially just after midnight, and the weekends. But you'd get used to it. You live literally in the centre of town, so can't complain about the noise! The window is single-glazed but the college, apparently, is going to install double-glazing, and is currently awaiting the city council to approve it (since the building is a rated one, but I fail to see how.)\n\nAlso, the door is paper-thin. So all your conversations in your room can be heard quite clearly in the corridor (and vice versa). I hope you get reasonably quiet neighbours.",
                "Worst Features": "Also the size - because you can only ever fit 6 people in there comfortably (I will experiment with more later), so little possibility of a proper party. The lack of a full-length mirror anywhere; and the mirror in the room is way too high to be useful. The door does not shut properly even if you slam it. And no sink in the room - the sink in the toilet is tiny. The window also rattles very badly on a windy day and the door seems to rattle with it too.\n\nSince the window is at the same level as the entrance to St Mike's Court H staircase, the people coming in and out from there frequently stare into the room. It felt a bit like being an animal in the zoo, especially when I am eating ('feeding time!').",

                "Best Features": "It is massive. The living room alone is bigger than many rooms in college, and the bedroom's not tiny either. And it has the wow factor - this is a really old school cambridge set. Loads of nice furniture, your own kitchen, great bathroom facilities...etc.",
                "Furniture": "Absolutely loads. Living room has 1 sofa, 2 armchairs, desk chair, 2 other chairs, dining table, massive desk, coffee table, shelves, random cool cabinet, a few cupboards...probably loads of other stuff that I've forgotten. Bedroom has chest of drawers, wardrobe, another chair. Lighting-wise, living room has 2 ceiling lamps and a rather cool and powerful standing lamp, + a desk lamp. Bedroom has a ceiling lamp and a light above the mirror.",
                "General": "If one of your priorities is a really light room, don't pick this one. If it's not, then almost definitely do. This is a genuinely fantastic room, and is in a convenient location for just about everything.",
                "Gyp Room": "Can't get much nearer really - it's in the bedroom! So obviously it's your own kitchen. Has a microwave, george foreman, toaster, kettle, fridge, though not really room to have them all out at once. Only downside is that your bedroom will smell of whatever you cook for a while...and also the sink is a bit small for washing up.",
                "Heating": "Pretty good. Living room has one electric heater on the wall and one portable one, which is great - if it is cold you can just stick it right next to you. They're both fairly good, cold has only ever been a problem when its been like -10 or something. Bedroom never gets cold - one insanely powerful heater. Though it does smell oddly of burning every so often...",

                "Noise Level": "Not too much. Living room very quiet, bedroom gets a bit of noise from senate house passage and from the bateman room if anything's on in there, but not enough to be a problem.",
                "Worst Features": "Lack of natural light, although doesn't bother me too much as, being a natsci, I tend to be out for much of the day. Also the weird bedroom/gyp room hybrid does have its disadvantages. But really, these are pretty minor points.",

Standard, reasonably comfy bed.",

                "Best Features": "Living in town is amazing. Really nice having two rooms - even though there is no physical door, it definitely feels like two separate spaces. Also feels like a big room. By being at the top of the building, you are as far away from the housekeeper as possible, and i've never been stopped for being loud past hours (by the housekeepers. Your friends can still hear you). Also there is a sink in the bedroom! So if you are too lazy to head to the toilet boiz....",
                "Furniture": "Furniture description is in other reviews. Only annoying thing is that the only bit of furniture of all that is the bed, everything else is in the living room because the doorway between the two rooms is a stupid shape/size. Would be worth considering dismantling a wardrobe and moving it in the bedroom, if you are bothered. Beanbag not included. Oh and only one desk lamp - so do you prefer light at your desk? or a night lamp? difficult dilemmas indeed",

No george foreman, but running downstairs one level to use theirs is really not the hardest thing in the world.Plenty of cupboard space and a good microwave/convection oven. Toaster has bagel function - and your stuff is unlikely to go missing, because nobody comes to the top floor to steal mugs",

                "Natural Lighting": "By no means a very dark room, but is definitely not the best room if you love natural light, as the window in the living room is small - you do however get a lovely view of the mcdonalds back exit, and (legitimately) can actually see over the immediate building, and see Kings and Caius in the sunset (just)",
                "Noise Level": "Hard to say - I sleep quite well, but you face on to the back of mcdonalds, so you will get some noise from them. At the same time, that noise will be minimal because you are at the very top of the house! Also as you are at the top of the house, you probably won't hear any night time excitement from other rooms...Or maybe my roommates just weren't getting lucky",

                "Best Features": "Top of the house, so slanty walls. Definitely more than enough space; larger room is a very decent size and the smaller one can be a bedroom/clothes room, with a sink in. Best location ever for clubs/college/library, also Sainsburys at the top of the street - becomes your fridge.",
                "Furniture": "Pretty good, furniture-wise. Two chairs plus desk chair, desk, wardrobe, bookcase, nice shelving unit and a coffee table in the main room. Chest of drawers and a weird small wooden chair in the smaller room. Not sure sink and pinboard count as furniture, but they're there too.",
                "General": "Plenty of plug sockets. Not recently decorated but that means posters are not a problem with the housekeeper/bedder. A little out of the way of the main part/group of rooms in 27 Green St but a very, very nice set. Recommended.",
                "Gyp Room": "Just downstairs (room 13 is at the top of its own mini flight of stairs), shared with 4 or so people - pretty negotiable because there are more than enough kitchens in the whole house, so you don't necessarily need to use the one nearest to you if you'd rather share with specific people. Not very big but does still have its George Forman. Not very much fridge space but enough cupboards.",

                "Natural Lighting": "Not amazing, but then again it hasn't been summer yet",
                "Noise Level": "Definitely not quiet, smaller room's window looks on to Green Street so that's usually relatively noisy, and the larger room seems to have some sort of fan heater/generator whirring outside it most of the time, but really shouldn't be a problem so long as you're not a stupidly light sleeper - never ever too loud to work",

Whole floor of main room on a strange, but slightly endearing, slant, not really too much of a problem, definitely get used to it.

Plenty of space in both wardrobe and chest of drawers.  Powerful radiator can be turned up to ensure room nice and cosy.  Plenty of sockets to choose from for power, network, phone and even TV aerial socket.  Bedder is nice but will only empty bin.  Have to keep room and gyp room clean yourself.",

I preferred the larger one as there was more space to store dishes.  Both equipped with hobs, microwave, foreman, kettle.",

I like to keep mine open sometimes because you get to hear people say ridiculous things when they pass by.",
                "Worst Features": "If you have a lot of luggage this room may not be for you because there isn't much storage space - there's a bit over the wardrobe and you may keep things under the bed, but not much more. Also since the location is so great, it does mean that you will definitely need to vacate your room during the breaks, unless you have 39 week rent. \nAlso, the some walls are pretty solid but others not so much; these walls plus the floors and ceilings are pretty thin, so noise travels really easily between rooms. You should hope you have relatively silent neighbours.",

                "Best Features": "In the middle of town, so right next door to Sainsburys, the clubs, college and pretty much everything else. Takes about 10 mins to walk to Parkers Piece, 10 minutes to walk to Sidgewick. There\u00c2\u2019s also usually always place to park your bike outside. The room is nice and cosy, especially because of the heating and dim lighting. The hob and oven are also very handy.",
                "Furniture": "Pretty comfy bed, desk, desk chair, coffee table, oldish armchair, chest of drawers and shelves. Lots of shelves. Almost the whole of the longest wall is taken up by them. 6 plug sockets. A large notice board. Built in, okayish sized wardrobe, maybe a just over a metre of hanging space. Also comes with a floor length mirror too which is good, although the room is often too dark to see yourself properly in it.",
                "General": "Pretty good room to live in. Average sized room for the house, but considerably smaller than the other rooms Caius has to offer. Also, because the housing on the other side of the road is so close and the windows are pretty much level, you don\u00c2\u2019t get much privacy since you can basically see into their room and them into yours.",
                "Gyp Room": "Pretty good and right next door to the room. Shared with 3 other people. There\u00c2\u2019s a hob, oven, toaster, microwave, kettle. Only one George Foreman in the house, which is located down on the first floor (this is the third floor). Floor is quite slopey though so if you have to make sure you close the fridge door completely or else it swings open. I also got the kitchen cupboard which doesn\u00c2\u2019t close, probably because of the slopey floor again.",
                "Heating": "Good heating, which is necessary since the window doesn\u00c2\u2019t close properly so there\u00c2\u2019s always a draught. The draught is particularly annoying when you\u00c2\u2019re working at your desk and you can feel the cold coming in. The curtains do a good job at blocking it out though.",
                "Natural Lighting": "Pretty poor since the sun is blocked by the opposite housing. Window is also quite small and the curtains quite big, so even when open the curtains block half of what potential sunlight could come through. I changed the bulb to a brighter one since the artificial lighting was pretty bad too, although it\u00c2\u2019s still not as bright as I would have liked. Makes the room quite cosy looking though",
                "Noise Level": "Can get quite noisy, especially at night with drunk people walking past and in the early morning when the trucks do the deliveries for the nearby shops. During the day it's not too bad, only really the pigeons who sit on the window ledge and watch you work. On the weekends, can sometimes hear the events going on in Market Square although it's not too bad. Walls and floor are thin though, so you can hear people on the corridor and room below quite audibly.",
                "Worst Features": "It\u00c2\u2019s up three flights of stairs so your legs will be pretty toned by the end of the year. A bit of a nightmare carrying of luggage since they\u00c2\u2019re also quite narrow and the walls slant inwards on them on the third flight. The noise coming from both inside and outside the house can also get annoying.",

This hasn't proved to be a problem though, and you rarely need to wait for too long for a shower.",
                "Best Features": "Very cosy room, just the right size between being too big&cold and small&suffocating. Yellow walls and nice curtains give it a very friendly and homely atmosphere. It is on the top floor, which means that it is probably a bit more quiet and private than rooms on other floors. Bathroom and kitchen are very close.",

An in-built wardrobe which has two shelves and quite a lot of hanging space. A very large noticeboard (covered in ugly green paper). There are loads of shelves on the walls, and a full-length mirror! One desk lamp is provided, and there is one central light, but this doesn't give a lot of light due to quite low ceiling. One wall is slanted, but this doesn't reduce the size of the room significantly.",
                "General": "Overall, this has been a lovely room to live in! The location is great, too - just next to Sainsbury\u00b4s and a few minutes from college, above the Bill\u00b4s and Caf\u00e9 Munch. As said above, it will probably get a new window, which should limit the draft and noise (although that isn't such a big problem).",
                "Gyp Room": "The gyp room is just next door! It is shared with three other people and is quite small (and has slanted walls), but otherwise quite good - it has a fridge, hobs, oven, grill, microwave oven, kettle and toaster (G Foreman grill somehow disappeared, but nobody seems to have noticed...). There are enough cupboards for everyone, and also various common kitchen utensils, such as cheese grater and cake tin! The biggest problem is the slanted *floor* - not enough to make you feel it, but you need to make sure yous stir your food well when cooking... Otherwise it will burn on one side like my pasta sauce.",
                "Heating": "Since the college is planning to install a new window, this room should be ok. There is a radiator here, which heats the room well, and once the draft from the window is gone, it should be perfect.",
                "Natural Lighting": "Very poor. Sunlight is blocked by the buildings opposite and the one window is very small. It is generally better in the afternoons than in the mornings, but not much.",
                "Noise Level": "Noise is not a big problem in this room, since it is on the highest floor. Pigeons can be quite loud and persistent sometimes, and during weekends and evenings you can hear guests from the restaurant below and people on the street, but this is not very loud. The worst thing probably is the very heavy door of gyp room (which is just next to this room) - when the door slams, the walls shake... But overall probably one of the quieter rooms in this house, especially given that it faces the street.",
                "Worst Features": "The sound of slamming kitchen door, shattering tons of glass when the waste collectors come to the Bill\u00b4s in the morning. Lack of natural light (and the electrical is poor). This isn't helped by the fact that people live just a few metres across the street, so keep your curtains shut.",

                "Best Features": "There are very few rooms slap bang in the centre of town (right next to Sainsburys) and are very quiet, and this is one of them.

                "Furniture": "Plenty of shelving space - quite hard to fill it all even with reading and stuff from last year. Storage space is quite limited, with a super small built-in wardrobe shaped weirdly because of the ceiling and a set of drawers without much depth. Highly recommended to get a clothes rack from Argos if you are female. The desk is of good size, and an overhead lamp and a bed lamp (really dim) are provided. You are recommended to get your own desk lamp for academic purposes.",
                "General": "Quite a cosy room at a central location with little noise. Has 4 sockets but extension boards are recommended. Internet was unstable but not with ethernet fixed, internet is at an amazing speed with no downloading limit! The main major drawback is the sloping floors. Rent is on the expensive side compared with other rooms in 37 Green Street. Other rooms in the house with the same rent price are larger and have more storage space (although more noise too).",
                "Gyp Room": "The gyp room is well equipped and shared with 3 other people on the floor. As of all rooms on the top floor, the floor is a bit slanted and the size is a bit small, but it has everything you need - a microwave, hobs, an oven, and a griller. Used to have a George Foreman as well but somehow it disappeared (although no one used it except for making toasties).",
                "Heating": "Adequate heating situated right beside the bed, which means that during freezing nights, you will feel cold when working at the table and piping hot when on the bed in your blanket next to the heater.",
                "Natural Lighting": "Usually quite well lit. As it is the top of the house, it is above most other adjacent buildings and allows plenty of natural light. Although the sun seems to be in your face during the mornings and can make this small room steaming hot in the afternoons.",
                "Noise Level": "Quiet in general, not much noise from the street as facing the back. Separated room from others means that you won't be able to hear your neighbours either (unless they are shouting in the corridor or trudging up the stairs).",
                "Worst Features": "The size. It is probably the smallest room in 37 Green Street, with sloping ceilings and uneven floors. The wardrobe is tiny (and also slanted so makes it not very useful!). Be careful when sitting at the desk - if you push yourself slightly from the desk you will find that your chair will uncontrollably slide towards the bed.",

Was very friendly and warned us current might fluctuate, but said my fridge was my business: no problems yet). Housekeeper also provides minifridges for rooms if you ask nicely and point out that the facilities are crap.

Be warned that there's only two plug sockets in the whole room, and they're by the desk so will definitely not reach the bed. Bring some extension reels! The room comes with two lamps, one decent and one crappy, so no need to bring your own unless you want a good desk lamp and a good bedside one.",

                "Best Features": "Apart from the above wardrobe features, the best thing about the room is the layout. It is neither too cosy nor too roomy, and the radiator is fantastically warm in winter. The high ceiling makes the place feel roomier as well. Plenty of picture hooks - 7 in total! - mean you can make the place quite bright and cheerful. Buzzer from door is connected to a phone in each room - useful but incredibly loud!

No one I know has ever sat in it).\nThe wardrobe has two particularly good features. The first is the hidden compartment behind the mirror; the second is the fold-down front to one of the drawers which works fabulously well as a drinks cabinet!",
                "General": "Sunlight mostly in morning, which is good for waking-up. The bedder is lovely, but of course it might not be the same person next year. The carpet is not exactly attractive but it does its job of keeping the place warm. Decor is cheerful in cream and white. Wardrobe space is reasonable unless you have masses of clothes you need to hang up. Heating is wonderful! Sockets are extremely limited - only two, so I recommend putting your computer in that corner, and the bed by the window. You will need a 10-metre extension lead if you want an alarm clock/lamp by your bed. Space under bed for putting away boxes and cases.

                "Bathroom": "The showeroom downstairs (near to the room) is also shared between 5 people and is quite large. The shower doesn\u00c2\u2019t seem as powerful as the one in the small room upstairs which people from downstairs may use.",
                "Best Features": "The room is very spacious with a very high ceiling and with a lot of natural light and plenty of places to store things.",
                "Furniture": "The lighting provided may not be quite sufficient when the curtains are closed as only one desk lamp is provided and the main light is quite dim. The furniture provided includes a bed, fairly large desk (drawers don\u00c2\u2019t shut properly), wardrobe with drawers (old), small desk chair (may cause back problems), 2 soft chairs, low coffee table, a cabinet with drawers and a small bedside table.",
                "General": "As a physicist, the location is quite convenient as it\u00c2\u2019s roughly in between the Cavendish and the New Museums Site, which are about 18 minutes and 8 minutes away respectively when walking (I don\u00c2\u2019t cycle). The old courts are about 10 minutes away and the UL is only about a 5 minute walk through Harvey Court. The gardens surrounding the house are nice with a lot of wildlife to be seen. However, despite the convenience Springfield may seem to some people quite isolated from the other Caius accommodation.",
                "Gyp Room": "The ground floor kitchen is shared between 5 people, which is reasonable considering that there are 2 fridges (each with a freezer compartment) and more than enough cupboard space, although the room is quite small in size. There are also the usual foreman grill, toaster, kettle and microwave/oven. The washing machine and tumble dryer are shared with the nursery, these being used by the nursery most of the time.",
                "Heating": "The heating is good in the sense that the radiator in the room heats up very quickly when you turn it on, but the main problem with the heating is that the house is normally too warm, even in winter, due to the radiators in the corridor normally being fully on which I don\u00c2\u2019t think can be turned down. The hot water pipes in the room are generally almost scalding to touch. As a result, I never turn on the radiator in the room, and sometimes find that even in winter I have to open a window to be able to sleep comfortably. Hopefully this problem will be fixed by next year.",

                "Noise Level": "Generally quite quiet, with traffic noise almost unnoticeable. The main source of noise is from the nursery on weekdays from 9-3 which can be irritating if you\u00c2\u2019re in for long periods at these times, but as a physicist I generally had lectures or supervisions then.",
                "Worst Features": "As well as the general heating problem in Springfield there have been occasional other problems such as there being no hot water in the kitchen for a period of several weeks and a time when the upstairs showeroom started to flood with the water pouring onto the ground floor through cracks in the ceiling. Regarding the room, the view of the parking area is worse than the view from most of the other rooms and offers less privacy, as people often walk/cycle pass the window. The furniture could be in better condition too.",

There's no secure storage like the overheads in SHB but I was able to leave loads over the Christmas break so speak to housekeeping when the time comes around.",
                "General": "The room gets a decent amount of sunlight but there are tall trees close by. The room itself has cream walls and a very high ceiling (five paces if you could walk up the wall). There are two plug sockets by the bed and another two by the side of the desk, where two network sockets also reside.

The ground floor (five people) share it but there are plenty of cupboards. Room 7 is eleven paces away from the gyp room.

Room 8 is directly opposite the first (with just a toilet and sink). Very handy so you don't have to walk far (but as mentioned everything is easy to access upstairs).\n\nNo baths in the house. People complain about the strength of showers here (especially the one in the larger bathroom upstairs) but I'm honestly puzzled since I have never had a problem. I think it depends on when you use them.",
                "Best Features": "The size - it's one of the largest if not the largest in Springfield and Springfield already raises the bar in terms of room sizes across Caius. Two windows is really nice. See room 10's review for some birds that you can hunt for if you are a keen birdwatcher.",
                "Furniture": "Room comes with a bunch of furniture - a desk table and swivel chair, dining table, and a bunch of chairs (3 or 4 I believe? Not there at the moment - two are armchair type ones). Nice to have chairs for people to sit on, or if you have no friends you can just dump things onto them if you prefer. \n\nOne lamp is provided which is okay, but if you want a lamp on the desk as well as light for reading in bed or on the dining table then you might have to bring your own. The ceiling light is fine but not strong enough to read from easily when it gets dark.",
                "General": "General comments about Springfield - it's really nice. It's also fairly quiet and remote-ish (although is only 10 mins walk from centre of town), which means I would recommend balloting with a group of friends. I think if I was here on my own it wouldn't be as good.\n\nTo clarify the room layout, since I remember being confused when balloting, this room (room 8) is upstairs, along with 9, 10, 11, and 12. Rooms 8 and 9 face out on the driveway, rooms 10, 11, 12 I believe face out onto the garden or possibly towards HC (12?). All the other rooms are downstairs. \n\nI personally chose to go upstairs because of general security and privacy and it really paid off - I never have to worry about people snooping in from the garden or nursery and in summer I'll be able to leave windows open without being on guard.\n\nSpeaking of the nursery, there is a washing machine + tumble-dryer in the downstairs kitchen which is ALWAYS in use during the day, so plan to do your washing in the dead of night or take it to HC nearby (also advised not to look too closely at the contents of the washing machine, babies + baby food + playdoh = ???).\n\nThe bedder is fantastic here, she always checks if you are in and is really polite and nice, and is friendly first thing in the morning. Top marks.\n\nAll in all if you don't need too much of a party atmosphere then Springfield is perfect - of course, fill the house with friends and it would be great for that too.",
                "Gyp Room": "Kitchen upstairs is nice enough, with a view of the garden to enjoy while you microwave your ready meals. Two cupboards each and nice worktop space if you are more of a cooking person, but obviously the Caius anti-hob stance means that you still have to deal with just a microwave and George Forman (never used that myself). \n\nShared with everyone upstairs, but this year I generally never had a problem with congestion, everyone seemed to keep to themselves mostly. This floor is fairly small and so it's really not far to the kitchen from any room (but room 8 is far enough away that you don't get annoying kitchen noises all the time).",
                "Heating": "The heating for this room works a bit like magic - I haven't had the radiator on at all this year and yet the room is always warm (perhaps from the room beneath, through the floor or something?). Of course the radiator is there if you want to turn the room into an oven, and both windows open fully if you want to cool down. \n\nThere was a period in Springfield when the heating suddenly went on full blast all over the house, which was ridiculous - but this room stayed ok. Other rooms not so much - it was extremely unpleasant.",

                "General": "two times two sockets, something about the washing facilities: there is a washing machine and a tumble dryer (both very good) in the kitchen downstairs (hence that kitchen always has a funny smell and is by far not as nice as the one upstairs), the problem is that during daytime during the week both are literally all the time used by the adjacent nursery (-1/2 Mark for that): I ended up doing most washings during the night (i.e. 11 to 6) but it might be possible to get better times especially during the weekend if one wants to regularly check if it's free, I found the location of Springfield (as a physics stiudent) very convinient in general: >10 to 15 minutes walk to old courts (Silverstreet is fastest), similarly to new museums site, with a bike both ways are under 10 minutes (including locking it), the University Library is close (5 Minutes) and with a bike it is possible to get to Cavendish (which seems sooo far way) in just above 5 Minutes and leisurely in 10 to 15, most ways (i.e. through the backs) include nice scenery and no very busy (for Cambridge) places like St. Andrews Street",

Its also nice for drying clothes. Even during the colder times in winter I did not use the radiator daily as the building is generally quite warm.",
                "Natural Lighting": "Very big window to the east. During Winter it was only really bright in the morning, but always enough light to work on the desk during daytime without using the desk lamp. Both halfs of the window can be conviniently opened to any extend I ever needed. When the curtains were closed I could sleep any time of the day.",
                "Noise Level": "Very quiet. A constant humming background from Queensroad: quieter at night but louder if the window is open. Never disturbing except the eventual beeping at the crossroads. The nursery is at the other side of the building and I never heard any noise from it. Inside the building the room is in a corner upstairs and away from any bathroom, which leads to minimal annoying noises.The kitchen is adjacent but with my current neighbours I never had any problems with noise from it.",
                "Worst Features": "the mattress is according to the room report \"very soft and lumpy\" - it really is, but apparently it still counts as ok (hopefully it might get changed), the desk lamp bulb might fall of but that might get fixed too, -1/2 Mark for the mattress",

The fireplace is amazing (see photos), weirdly the equivalent room in house 2 has a less nice fireplace. Curtains are very effective at cutting out light at night so the street lights don't shine through. Whole house done up summer 2011 so pretty sweet compared to some other accommodation! Feels really homely and great if you are with a big group of friends. The garden is a big bonus too which you don't get in old courts - it still gets maintained by college very regularly and you can walk all over the grass whenever you fancy. 2 squirrels provide ample entertainment when your essay is going less well. Being at the back of the house is a bit more private as fewer people can gaze in from Mill Rd. If you have enough stuff to fill all the furniture, you have too much stuff to fit in one car. Desk has room for chair + 2 legs; many in Caius do not. College got me a new(ish) bed this year so there is now a nice non-sagging mattress and new bed frame. Laundry is right next door in the garage of house 2.\nGreat St Mary's is too far away to wake you up on Sunday mornings.\nClose to Grafton centre and Asda.\nEthernet, lapwing and eduroam - routers just outside the room.

It's also very near my room, so - unlike other housemates - I don't have to pad up and down the staircase in my towel every time I want a shower. Toilet's next to it.. pretty standard as toilets go..",
                "Best Features": "The bay window is a big plus because it looks out onto parker's piece and just gives the room a really nice, natural light. The marble fireplace is lovely and the wardrobe is big (and has four compartment/shelf things on the side - so good for storing heels in if you're a girl). It's absolutely vast as well (something i definitely wasn't expecting having turned up to balloting late, and all the other rooms being allocated) and is just a really great spot in the house being near the gyp room, shower and main door (so v. social).",
                "Furniture": "Lovely big bay window which lets in lots of light, and since I shifted around the furniture so that the desk was directly in front of it (you can thank me later) it's a really lovely place to work. The desk is big, with good drawers for papers and files; there's decent clothes drawers and a cupboard, and there's a really gorgeous marble fireplace with two comfy chairs underneath. There's a funny bar-type thing as well which actually has a wine holder in - pretty bizarre for an average undergraduate's room, but it looks cool and at least gives you somewhere to store all those alcohol bottles when the parents come to visit..",
                "General": "Overall - a really, really lovely room, second in the house only to room 3. If it was in college it would be snapped up by a third year, the only 'problem' is that it's about a 5-10 minute cycle from town. It also opens up a side of Cambridge that you don't get to see in first year/when you live in town: mill road is great (legendary chip shop about 30 seconds away), grafton nearby, vue cinema nearby, uni gym very nearby, and nice restaurants dotted all along the side of parker's piece.",
                "Gyp Room": "Gyp room has a really lovely view over the garden (which has a pear tree!) - it's small but warm cause the boiler's in there, which makes it a particularly social spot come winter.

                "Worst Features": "The bed has no headboard, and instead the bedside table is behind the head of the bed.. meaning you can wake up with your pillows half way across the bedside table if you move around at all. But it can't really go anywhere else, cause otherwise it cuts off the desk. Similarly, the bed's next to the radiator.. so you can naively drop off next to it only to be woken up burning when it turns on at about 5am.",

It's a bit small, but there's never a problem of getting too cold and the power is more than enough. The bathroom that you'll be using is half a flight of stairs up from where you live (so pretty close). This is the biggest bathroom and is shared by 4. The flush refills almost instantaneously, so good if you practice mercy flushing. There is a bath in there, but no one smart uses it for showers. Even with an attachment it's just too weak, so if you do use it, it'll be for a bath, not a shower.",
                "Best Features": "You're right next to the gyp room and bathroom, you can see who's ringing your door bell before deciding whether they're worth going down for and there's technically two rooms so the entrance room can be used for dumping stuff or just as a sound buffer when you want to listen to some guilty-pleasure music. But really, the best thing about the house, and the only reason someone picks a house like this is because you get a whole house for you and your friends. There's no communal living area so the staircase ends up stuffed with people. As long as you're on good terms with your housemates, you'll let slip the fact it's just not as pretty as the other houses on the road.",
                "Furniture": "Not going to lie. Compared to houses 3-4 and definitely 5-8, the furniture is rather uninspiring. All wooden, fairly old, but because of the sheer lack of anything extraordinary in the room, it's basically a blank canvas for you to do with as you wish. There is a working table which is more than adequate. The 2008 room 7 reviewer has the same one and reckons it's too small, but if you use a bit a space management and common sense you can fit a flat screen, keyboard and a4 pad right in front of you without a problem. One crappy work chair, desk, 2 comfy airmchairs, small coffee table, shelves, large wardrobe, 2 sets of drawers and a combi cupboard/drawer. All in all a lot of storage space.",
                "General": "Bedder = awesome. Very friendly, actually knocks and waits before entering, if you let her tidy your room she will make it immaculate. Plenty of sockets, but needed extensive use of extenders to get enough power sockets to the computer table. Lighting's not great at night so highly recommend bringing another light. I didn't see any reviews for this room before opting for it, because it wasn't available last year (guess it went to a postgrad). It's better than the basement rooms, larger than ground floor ones (but less impressive furniture). Slightly smaller than room 8 (in fact it's almost a clone) but less pretty. It's not the best room in the house, but I reckon it's better than most of them.",
                "Gyp Room": "More like a very small walk-in-wardrobe which just so happens to have 2 fridges, combi-microwave and george foreman grill. You can comfortably fit in 2 people (out of the 8 that use it), but it never ends up being too much of a problem, especially if there are only 2 people in the house who *can* cook (and are willing to share their food). The staircase outside the gyp room serves as a good dining area, but the dining table in room 5 can fit everyone in the house (so make sure you befriend this person)",

The bass from above passes through, but then again, so will yours.",
                "Worst Features": "I keep my computer right up against the only radiator in the bedroom, so have to keep that off. Thus the room gets very cold at night. But that's my own fault, really. There's still a radiator in the \"living room\", so you can do that for heating the main room. Speaking of the living room, it's pretty much useless. I just use it for dumping stuff/furniture that I don't want in my bedroom . It can be used for a receptionist, but I didn't have a need for one this year. If you've got one, though, bring her along. My biggest gripe was that we hadn't been networked and because we were meant to be networked we weren't going to be reimbursed for paying for our own internet. But hopefully caius will pull their thumb out and get you guys networked for next year onwards",

                "Best Features": "The location.  The room is directly above the Great Gate with fantastic views onto King's Parade.  There are two windows with a statue between them of who I believe to be Edmund Gonville, though he is affectionately referred to as 'Percy' by the current occupant.  Of course, the room is constantly being photographed - so in the event that you have nothing better to do, posing opportuinties are second to none.",
                "Furniture": "Being a smaller room, there isn't a great deal of furniture.  The desk is antique, large, heavy, leather topped and very nice indeed - though it could be moved elsewhere sometime.  There is also a bed, a small bedside table, a decent armchair and a desk lamp.  The wardrobe is small and built-in, and there are also some built in shelves in an alcove as shown by the photos.  The mantlepiece (attractive) and windowledges can be used as surfaces, and there is a cupboard under each window.",
                "General": "I really like this room - it has a great location and real character which I believe any future occupant will fall in love with.  It certainly has something of a WOW factor.  On the downside, at the higher end of the ballot you will have the choice of larger rooms with better facilities, such as more chairs or a sink etc.  The noise may be problematic for a particularly light sleeper or a room worker who is easily distracted by the activities on King's Parade - so these sorts of people should avoid O6.  If you're interested in the room, please feel free to drop me an e-mail.  And if you're reading this before July 2012, you're also welcome to pay a visit.",

                "Worst Features": "Nothing terrible.  I guess it's a fairly small room, it can get quite noisy and - like most Caius rooms - it is a little underfurnished.  The room is unsuitable for gatherings of more than a few people due to it's size, furnishing and location.  Also there's no sink.",

The other is a separate toilet and shower on this floor which is usually shared only with the person in the room next door - very convenient. Always clean. No bath. \n\nThere is also a sink in the room - so useful.",
                "Best Features": "The massive windows, size of the room (looks slightly bigger in the photos since they are panorama but still a very spacious room), garden at the back of the house, laundry facilities in the garden, the sink, proximity to bathroom.",
                "Furniture": "Desk, rolling desk chair, extendable dining table, two not very comfortable \"armchairs\", coffee table, large chest of drawers, bookcase, strange narnia like wardrobe, bed, full length mirror. The wardrobe is quite small but the drawers are very big so storage should not be an issue. \n\nFurniture is generally quite ugly - I bought blankets etc to cover up the chairs (see photos). \n\nLighting (apart from natural light) is quite bad. One overhead light, tiny ugly desk lamp and a light over the sink. I bought a new desk lamp, a reading lamp for the bed, and two lamps for on top of the fireplace. Would definitely recommend buying more lighting.",
                "General": "Ignore the darker looking photos - these are of room 4. \n\nI think this has been a really great room and house. Granted it is not in the centre of town but it literally takes less than ten mins to cycle in to college (you will need a bike to live here though). It's really nice to have the park right outside. \n\nCaius owns all the houses on the street so there is generally a very nice atmosphere and if you ballot with a group of your friends it's ideal. \n\nWould have given it a perfect 10 were it not for the location and the exposure to the street.",
                "Gyp Room": "Kitchen up one flight of stairs (a tray for carrying things comes in handy). Relatively small but not uncomfortably so. More than enough storage space for the 6 people in the house and 2 fridges. Has a microwave, kettle and george foreman. And windows which is nice.",

                "Noise Level": "The room is on the ground floor facing the street and there is a police station nearby so yes, there is some noise, but you get used to it really quickly and it has never bothered me.",
                "Worst Features": "If I had chosen again I would have chosen a room at the back of the house or on a different floor because the room is quite exposed - everyone who walks by can see you basically (especially since I had my desk at the window). This will not bother everyone - you could also just move the desk. \n\nThe location could perhaps be better (see general comments) and there are quite a few hobos, drug dealers and groups of rowdy guys hanging around but I have never felt threatened by it and it provides for good entertainment. \n\nIf I'm going to be picky some more hanging space for clothes would have been nice and better lighting but these issues are easily resolved.",

I tend to use the one upstairs which is like a normal bathroom - something like you might actually get in a house, which I think is nice. Plenty of room to use the shower and change in there etc. Shower is fine, not as powerful as others at Caius (not that I have an extensive knowledge...) but reliably always hot water. Doesn't get too busy, and if it's busy there's always downstairs. No bath.",
                "Best Features": "Sink in room, quite a nice view of Parker's Piece (unlike houses further along the road), the room is huge, it's a set...",
                "Furniture": "Furniture in this room was described by a previous reviewer as 'eclectic' so wasn't sure what to expect, but now I know what they mean. Living room furniture is such: 1 adequately sized, reasonably modern (compared to the rest of the room) style desk with plenty of drawers. 1 drinks cabinet/characterful side unit - great storage but one door doesn't stay shut. 2 armchairs, 1 really comfy one (honestly, it has improved my life at Cambridge), 1 less comfy one. 1 longish coffee table, 1 average old bookshelf and 1 weird old dining table which extends enough to fit a small family around it (although I've not tried). Oh and the world's poxiest wardrobe - it really is tiny and the door doesn't stay shut. Luckily I took the advice of a previous reviewer and 'got one of those clothes rail doodahs' - they were right, no matter who you are, you WILL need one! Bedroom has: 1 standard bed, 1 well sized chest of drawers.  Only lighting provided is in the form of a ceiling lamp in each room and a little light above the sink.",
                "General": "Sockets - there are plenty. It was redecorated just before I moved in Summer 2010 so still feels nice and new and clean. I love having such a big room - there's even enough room for any larger excess items you might bring (I have a keyboard). The location is not the safest to walk back to at night for a young female, but it is a lot better now the tramp situation (see previous reviews) has been properly dealt with and it's nice to see a different, more 'real' side of Cambridge for a year. Overall, I love this room, even though I was dubious at the start. It's big, it's a set (even if you do walk into the bedroom part) and feels really homely. If you want a room on Morty, this, along with the one directly above it (I think 7?) and the same ones in house 1 are some of the best to go for!",
                "Gyp Room": "Shared with 5 other people. Half a flight of stairs from the room. Very good: adequate toaster, microwave, George Foreman, lots of cupboard space for 6 people. It is small, but a little bigger than the very tiny gyp rooms in old courts. Also newly refurbished in Summer 2010 so  modern and not yet grotty.",
                "Heating": "Generally good as is normal central heating which you control yourself on the radiator itself and downstairs on the thermostat (could lead to thermostat wars?!). Very big radiator in living room, but as desk is currently in front of window it can get very draughty around the feet whilst working - it's only single glazed! Bring warm socks and a blanket for winter.",

                "Worst Features": "Draughty by the window in winter; can feel quite isolated from the world, being shut off from the rest of the house with 2 fire doors (maybe that's just me?); challenging to light up the room when it's dull outside; the weird wardrobe.",

(I'm still not cycling to the Sidgwick site, and the walk only takes me just over 20 minutes, although I am very much in the minority on that front!) It's convenient for the Grafton Centre for shopping and the cinema, Kelsey Kerridge, Parkside Pool and Fenner's cricket ground and gym if you're into sport, and nearer Tesco and Asda if you're fed up of Sainsbury's. Also, it's nearer to the train station, and is more convenient for moving your stuff in and out at the beginning and end of term, as you can park right up outside the front door and don't need a parking permit like in the centre of town. You'll have access to a locked bike shed at the side of house 4. You have to pay separately for gas, electricity and laundry, as well as \u00a31 a night for guests, and you'll be subjected to a bunch of rules from the housekeeper, such as 'put the bathmat down before you have a shower' and 'use a coaster', but you'll get used to it, and she's really quite nice once you get used to her.",

House 4's gyp room has a normal microwave which we can use, but I brought a combination microwave and another house mate brought a George Foreman grill, so we could cook properly. As the rest of college has banned hobs and other cooking equipment not provided by college, this has worked out pretty well for us, but it is a pain that we have had to provide these items ourselves!

The fireplace is a nice feature too, and there's also a full length mirror.

Very large room with loads of cupboard space, shared formally with 4, but about 6 members of the house use it, and there's still lots of space. We bought our own dining table as it is so big and it's made it into a really good communal room.

                "Worst Features": "I've had no problems with the room itself. But I would be careful as there is a live in housekeeper who lives in the basement of number 6. We've had a few run ins with her over the year - she tends to complain a lot about the state of the kitchen, even if it's not that messy, get irritated if we make much noise late at night, and she likes to empty the bins from about 8.45 onwards (so no good having lie-ins on those days!). While she's never formally complained about us and this hasn't overly bothered us, it has been an irritant and I would recommend choosing a house without a live-in housekeeper as your top choice.",

The shower sometimes whistles for fun, and you'll get used to the massive extractor fan that turns on every time you switch on the light.",
                "Best Features": "Massive, massive space. I managed to fit about 13 people in here for a movie night and it was only cramped because we had to face a tiny screen. NEW CURTAINS! You have me to thank for this because the ones before draped over the radiators and made the room feel like an ice cavern. They're really nice curtains now, and replaced a missing net curtain. Massive skylight which will be awesome in the summer. The room is just nice in general really, very little complaints about it.",

If you figure this out, check behind the radiator for your prize) and a standard and crappy desk chair. The wardrobe is possibly the worst thing ever and I'm a guy. Instead of having a rack going lengthways it comes OUT. So you have to put your shirts one behind the other and you'll spend lots of fun times taking out all but the last one and putting it back in. Did I also mention that it's TINY. Like it has one shelf and that stupid rack and that's it. There's a good chest of 4/5 drawers where most of my clothes have to go, a bedside table which is nice and another cupboard thing which has two small drawers and a large space beneath them. Oh, and there's a shelf above the fireplace as well as a coffee table. And finally, there's a really awful book case that teeters. Books won't fit in the shelf vertically, so mine sit horizontally.",

She was almost annoyed that I didn't ask her to get the curtains replaced. Cleans your room amazingly, does hoovering, thorough wiping etc. She even tidies away your washing up that you haven't yet done. Carpet.. is okay? If you're into browny/earthy carpet, nothing special. Lots of power sockets. You might need a slightly longer Ethernet cable though, maybe 3/5m depending on if you rotate your desk (I would recommend you do). Looooooong radiator that sits right underneath the two windows. Seriously, who designs these houses? Aside from that, have fun talking to each other over the intercom and being scared crapless when it buzzes so loudly that you can hear it in another room. :D enjoy.",

If you used good old George Foreman last year, you won't need to this year even though there is one. Kettle pisses on your feet, standard. Toaster good. Spacious cupboards. Sharing with 3 others, pretty large size. Could easily have a table in it and a few chairs and it's a shame that it doesn't (seeing as there isn't a living room). Only minor annoyances is that it's down one floor, and the water is funny in Morty. Like proper funny, the tap in the gyp room on the same floor as this room but for the house next door stays warm, never cold. The cold tap in the kitchen downstairs is okay, have to wait a few seconds before it gets cold. Also, get a Brita filter, the water is cloudy (I have no idea why).",

It does get quite cold every now and then when the radiator decides to switch off. If they move the desk back to where it was (blocking the radiator) then rotate it and you'll be nice and snug. Again, the wardrobe is terrible. Massive skylight which is not so awesome in the winter (or if you're a linguist and require major lie-ins for your tiring work of nothing all day).

The fire alarms are tested every friday afternoon, but it's only on momentarily. \n\nThe laundry room is actually in the garage of house 2.

There's also an ironing table. \n\nAlthough I said there's a network point, it's currently not connected to the network. There are conflicting rumours as to if/when we'll be connected.

I have never had to wait, but this wouldn't be a problem since there is also a toilet downstairs and another bathroom upstairs (used by rooms 4, 5 & 6), both within 10 seconds of this room.",
                "Best Features": "The Room is huge - about double an average Harvey Court room, with a high ceiling and a nice detail around the light. The windows allow a LOT of natural light. The fireplace is a nice feature. The location is actually very good (especially for medics) and the facilities in the house are very good.",

A small desk lamp is also included.",

A cycle ride to college is <10 minutes. Chemistry department is a 5 minute walk and you can reach the Downing site by going across Parkers Piece and through Downing college in <10 minutes on foot - even less if you cycle. Similar distance to New Museums site as from Harvey Court. Mill Road close for shops and a mini Sainsbury's just across Parker's Piece.\nThe bedder is very nice and helpful. There is an old lady who lives in the basement of house number 7 with a dog but I have never seen it nor been disturbed by barking.\nOverall this is a great room. I highly recommend it and it is possibly one of the best second year rooms you could have.",

Bring extension leads.  Extra lamps are also fairly necessary.",

                "Best Features": "The furniture means you have a lot of storage space and surfaces. The room is quite big for the price and right next to the gyp room! Living in Tree Court is lovely and although there are a lot of stairs, you get used to it, and it's good exercise. The room is quiet for living in the town centre. The sink is very, very handy.",
                "Furniture": "Normal bed, desk, chair, swivel chair, bookcase and coffee table. Nice little cupboard (with shelves) and bedside cupboard (with shelf and a drawer) too. Fitted sink (I don't think that many people have them on O) and shelving. I don't use the wardrobe, as the hanging space is TINY and it smells musty. I bought a clothes rail for about \u00a37 from Argos (ask Mum and Dad nicely, maybe). This also means that you can put the chair in front of the wardrobe door, which makes furniture arranging much better. (See pictures for details.) The mantelpiece is really useful too.",

This is a nice, quiet, big room in a beautiful part of Caius. It's not a room with huge 'wow' factor, but it's very comfortable and has everything you need. Just don't use the wardrobe, or chair/coffe table placement could get very tricky.",
                "Gyp Room": "Gyp rooms on O are AMAZING. THREE fridges, 2 microwaves and kettles, brand new cupbards, sinks and worktops and LOADS of space. About 7 people sharing it this year, which is just over two to a fridge. And it's right next to the room. Oh yes.",
                "Heating": "The heating is fine, stays pretty ambient. The radiator is under the window, which is the other side of the room from the bed, not the heat might not always travel that far. Aforementioned double glazing helps though.",
                "Natural Lighting": "Not a lot of natural light. The room does get quite dingy at about 3 o'clock (worse in Mich Term obviously). the room face east, so basically you get the sunrise, which means that your mornings are lovely and bright and your afternoons/evenings are dark. There is a shaver light above the sink which I usually keep on, which does help.",
                "Noise Level": "As the room is three floors up and has double glazing, there is usually very little noise. The odd noises do float up though: tourists shouting, bike bells ringing and drunk people (usually Caius Freshers) singing idiotically at the tops of their voices.",
                "Worst Features": "The room is quite dark, and the furniture is difficult to arrange if you use the wardrobe, as one entire wall is taken up by the fitted cupboards. Honestly I advise you to get a clothes rail, it's much more convenient. O staircase can be a bit echoe-y at times, but whether that's a problem or not depends on your neighbours and how much they talk on the staircase or slam their doors. Gyp room parties late at night may be a nuisance, but luckily I've not experienced that. The view is also pants.",

In general, however, the room is well-equipped, particularly as the desk is large enough to hold a PC while retaining enough space to do written work on it, so you can cover up the computer table and use it as a drinks table...or whatever you like...Oh, and there's a bed. Which isn't particularly stable. Just to warn you.",
                "General": "As I have already mentioned, the bedder is wonderful, and everything is very clean. There are also plenty of sockets providing you choose to have your desk in a sensible place. There is a carpet, which immediately makes it better than any Harvey Court Room, and the general decor is plain and inoffensive. You also have your own front and back door, which does mean that you can become a bit of a hermit as you rarely see anyone who lives above stairs, however, it does save climbing stairs.",

And having said that it is nice and warm, the radiator can get rather over-excited, and is not necessarily responsive to any attempts you may make to switch it off. The damp is just something you have to live with - there is plenty of room for a clothes rail should you need it.

All the furniture is pretty good apart from the shelves which are tiny - they can't even hold an A4 book vertically, they are that low. Also, the chest of drawers are quite small, so don't take this room if you have a lot of clothes! All of it is in good condition, and the comfy chairs are quite nice.",

G-Forbz and microwave like all good Caius rooms (both of which were replaced this year so you shouldn't have any trouble with them). It's a decent size, but you can't have all three people in there at once otherwise it is too much. Quite a fair bit of cupboard space for each person too.",
                "Heating": "During Michaelmas my room was boiling as the radiator is very good, but in the colder days of Lent the room can get a bit chilly even with the radiator on full as the windows lose a lot of heat.

                "Bathroom": "Again, this is shared by the 3 people who live on the floor, and is next door to the kitchen. Another relatively small room, with sloping roofs, but again, this doesn't cause any problems. The shower is pretty good for temperature and power, but does sometimes fluctuate between cold and hot water for no apparent reason for a minute or so, but not worth worrying about. No bath here - see Morty Road houses if you need one. Large wall mirror and a good amount of shelf space next to the sink. For those people who have come from ensuite accommodation in first year, and are worried about sharing a bathroom with other people - its honestly not a problem! I rarely find the room occupied, and if I do, there are bathrooms on all of the other 3 floors of the house.",
                "Best Features": "For student accommodation, this is really a great room, and a great house to live in. The window has a nice view out over the house's garden. The room is well sized - not too big that you find it difficult to fill the space, and not too small for it to be cramped. Loads of plug sockets, loads of furniture, everything you could want really. See general comments for more about the room and the house.",
                "Furniture": "Everything that can be seen in the photos uploaded by a previous occupant (minus the wooden chair). The furniture is really mismatched, but everything you would need is there. Large desk with 3 drawers and a lamp. 2 relatively comfortable armchairs. Low coffee table. Large bookcase with various shelf sizes. Standard Caius single bed. Small bedside table with 1 drawer. Large wooden storage unit with slide across door, which has absolutely no clear use other to put stuff on top of. Large wardrobe with two rails. Chest of drawers with 2 small drawers and 2 large ones, which has a mirror on top. Also a length mirror on the wall, and a large pinboard. Also has a filled in fireplace which is quite a nice feature for the room.",
                "General": "As I said above, this is a really good room, and a decent house too. The house has a total of 12 rooms, and there are a number of others in 6 Harvey too, so this is the perfect place to live if you are high up in the ballot and want to live with a large group of people. The other out of town houses (St Paul's Road and Morty Road) are really good for this too, but I think Harvey Road is maybe slightly nicer for location and general qualities (Morty have tramp problems and St Paul's have an ex-porter who lives in the basement apparently). People might say that living on Harvey Road might make you quite isolated from the rest of your year, but I don't think this has proven to be true at all. You still see people everyday around your faculty, in Caius or at hall, and the houses on Morty and St Paul's Road which will contain probably half of your year group are less than a 5 minute walk away if you want to make the effort.\nAs regards the living out-of-town vs. in-town problem, you might be worried that the houses on Harvey, Morty or St Paul's Road are far away from your faculty or from Caius, or generally from everything in town. To be honest though, I like it. Living out here feels like you are living in a different town, so it can provide a bit of an escape from the intimidating atmosphere of central Cambridge when you need it. There are some nice pubs to be found around, as well as all sorts going on next to or around Parker's Piece. The Graphton centre is close too, and there's a lot of choice of restaurants and shops on Hills Road and Mill Road. There is a small Sainsbury's between town and Harvey, and there is also a Co-op which is just down the road from the house, which is really convenient. The train station is really close too, which is really really helpful if you need to get the train home for the holidays. It feels like you live in a bit more of a real city in this part of town, whilst still being able to access everything that makes Cambridge Cambridge with a 5 minute cycle ride. All in the all, I think the location is actually an advantage, and is not at all to the house's detriment! Just make sure you have a bike, that's all I'd say. You can reach pretty much anyway in sub 10 minutes if you do, and makes life a hell of a lot easier!\nOther great things about the house include the fact that the house keeper, who is generally (stress on generally) helpful and pleasant, lives in the basement in 6 Harvey Road, so is rarely seen. This means you can get away with whatever pretty easily, without being watched by her or the porters, who never bother to check up or patrol this far from college. The cleaners are friendly and never get in the way at all. Perhaps the best feature of the house which makes it stand out from others though is the fact that room 7 has a balcony. Get a couple of deck chairs out there in the summer months with a well stocked mini-fridge and you're laughing - so make sure you know or make friends with the person who lives in room 7!\nTo summarise then, this room and house are awesome, and I don't at all regret my decision to live here! If you've got any other questions, feel free to email me (aem76) and I'll try and get back to you!",
                "Gyp Room": "Kitchen is shared between the 3 of us that live on the floor, and is very close to room 10. Its a pretty small room which isn't helped by the sloping roofs, and is quite cramped if all 3 of us are in there at the same time, but this really is never a problem. Standard Caius gyp facilities (fridge, microwave, George Foreman, toaster, kettle and sink) can be found, and there is ample cupboard space for 3 people. The kitchen on the floor below also has a freezer which is really useful, as well as the washing machine and dryer for the house, so you don't have to walk far at all to do your washing!",
                "Heating": "Big radiator on the back wall which belts out heat, and will warm up the room pretty quickly once turned on. There is a pretty big problem with the window however, which is slowly deteriorating over time with use and because of the weather. The window is two paned, and is opened by sliding the bottom pane up over the top one. When it is closed, there is a sizable gap between the two panes, and also a small gap at the bottom, which slowly drains the room of all heat. So if you leave the room for a whole day and forget to leave the radiator on then you'll be returning to a freezing cold room! This is a similar problem for a number of rooms in the house (room 11 for example). Hopefully college will get their act together and fix this before a new year move in, but its worth noting anyway! Shouldn't ever be a problem though if you remember to keep the radiator on.",
                "Natural Lighting": "Too much if anything! The window in the room is south-facing, which means it gets great, day-round natural light. However, you might find you have to keep the curtains closed through the morning if you're working at the desk and its a sunny day. This is also a problem, if, like me, you enjoy lying-in as late as possible in the morning. Otherwise though, room 10 is one of the best lit rooms in the house because of the window, as all the artificial lighting in the house is pretty poor.",
                "Noise Level": "Harvey Road and surrounding streets are in a pretty quiet residential area, so traffic noise is never a issue. However, if you like to work at home, and need near absolute silence, then you might have a problem when its break-time at the school on St Paul's Road which is behind the end of the house's garden, but this quickly becomes background noise, and doesn't really cause a problem.",
                "Worst Features": "The problem outlined above about the window is the only thing I've really had a problem with this year. The room decor is quite dingy, so be prepared to bring lots of posters, etc to decorate it and make it more personal. This isn't helped by the poor artificial lighting in the room. The plaster on the walls is also crumbling away quite badly in a number of places, which is something college should, again, really be sorting out before anyone else moves in. One of these spots is right above the bed, so I've had to put a poster up there so that I don't get covered in plaster in the night. This is really it regarding negative points though.",

All the other rooms in the house can feel quite empty without enough pieces of furniture or decorations, whilst this room has a warm feel to it with its sloping ceilings, slightly L-shaped space, and lovely furniture.

There are shops less than 5 minutes away, and parkers piece, if not a little scary at night, can be a nice place to chill in the sunshine.

                "Gyp Room": "Kitchens are on each floor in the house, so you share one between three people.

Four mirrors, catering for all heights. Good to have a full size wardrobe after SHB, I suppose. Even if the sun doesn't exactly stream through them, having all three sets of curtains drawn does give a nice grey-ish light, adding to the airy feel. Loads of plug sockets, even if some can't quite take a whole plug, well distributed. Very close to Fenners' gym and to the Chemistry lecture theatre (second year medic lectures), and still closer to the downing site than west road. Excellent bedder - cleans really well, nice generally. Don't suspect she takes too much shit though, so best to get off on the right foot there. Best shower in the house (by far, no experience of the first floor one.)",
                "Furniture": "Big wardrobe, good chest of drawers with attached mirror, small book case, nice large desk with two drawers on either side, bedside table, small lamp. Bed is absolutely GASH. Too short for a 6'3\" person, your feet are almost entirely off the bed. Shit mattress, seemingly hollow; doesn't stay on the base of the bed, which, even if it did, is actually less comfortable than if you put the mattress on the floor. Also a weird but pleasantly solid cupboard/sideboard thing, currently got computer on it. Desk chair isn't great, but is standard caius. Three big, lidded, storage 'bins' underneath the window, useful for keeping bags etc. Two overhead lights.",
                "General": "HUGE fireplace, dominates the western wall. There's a door to the equivalent room in 5 Harvey, which opens onto a reassuringly solid wall. If this room were a floor up and garden facing, it would be the best in the house.",
                "Gyp Room": "Fairly small kitchen on this floor shared between three (each floor has a kitchen and bathroom between three). There's a bigger one upstairs with a big/good freezer, washing machine, tumble dryer. George foreman, combi-microwave. Plenty of cupboard space, but no communal eating area in any kitchen.",
                "Heating": "Amazingly effective, minimally comfortable. Huge radiator that doesn't respond well to graduated commands. Fucking hot or quite cold. Combinations of radiator/window can achieve good results.",
                "Natural Lighting": "Two HUGE (each maybe 2.5 by 1.5 metres) windows facing out into the street and a smaller one looking towards Gresham road. North(ish) facing, and so not particularly bright at any time of day in winter. The room is also very deep, so while the area in the 'bay' of the window can be quite well illuminated, it looks pretty gloomy towards the radiator. Bit better on sunny days, but I'd still bring lots of lamps. In addition to the standard Caius desk lamp, I brought another desk lamp, two smaller table lamps, and an uplighter. This is just about enough. In fact, I really can't emphasise enough how dark this room can be - it's huge and manages to absorb any light you have.",
                "Noise Level": "The road itself is really quite quiet. The nursery opposite has never really been noticeable. Above the nursery is a housing association flat complex, which does tend to be a bit noisier, only really on saturday nights, and even then only a few times a term. That said, if there is ANY noise in the street, you'll hear it as if it's in your room. Especially with the (thin, huge) windows open, which is almost inevitable (see Heating). If the room above you makes a lot of noise you'll tend to hear it. The (nice) housekeeper is below, and all the bass from talking/music etc. goes straight through, so probably best to keep it down late at night.",
                "Worst Features": "On the ground floor, overlooking the street, north facing, far (far!) away from town. If you want a cosy hobbit-hole style thing, don't go for this room (top floor ones are better for that). Basically it's really quite a nice room (I'd say that room 10 is the best in the house, followed by the two first floor ones, then room 5, then this one).",

It could also have two floors if you felt like building a landing in between. It is, in fact, too big. There's now a big empty space in the middle of my room. Bring lots of things to fill the room with. Internet access is very useful, and if you know the other people i nthe house, it's really sociable (though not Harvey Court standards).

She does come in without fail at 9am every Monday morning (though a dutbin outside or a note will avoid this) so be careful if you sleep late on a Sunday...)\n\nBring multiplugs if you have lots of equipment. If you bring a TV, there's no point for the external aerial, so use a separate aerial. Signal is crap. The bikeshed outside is very useful, and is covered as well. The aple tree outside looks lovely, and I think we're allowed to grab apples. Garden is nice during summer to sit on and read.\n\nDecor is usual Caius. brown carpet in that fetching faecal colour. Light yellowish walls. Weird desk colour. Dodgy motel style curtains. You don't really notice the decor the room is so big.\n\nSome of the earlier reviews of this room mention that it is too cold - this is no longer the case. At the beginning of term, the college - displaying their usual level of generosity - refuse to switch on the heating for some time. But once it is on, there is no need at all to bring an extra heater unless you get very cold. A second blanket for the December/January might be nice, but wearing a T-shirt in my room during winter has been fine.\n\nThe best thing about this room, in my opinion, is that you can order Chinese food from the place on Lensfield Road and they deliver it. This in itself makes the room worth taking. The sweet and sour sauce justifies any doubts you may have about distance from town. Many people will be happy to corroborate this.\n\nIf you want to have a look at the room, feel free to pop round any time. I'd be happy to show you around the room and the house.",

In November I left my window on the ventilation notch (a little open, but secured) and my laptop was stolen by a hand reaching in. If you have a laptop, get a security cable and close your curtains when possible if you're going to be out.\n\nThere's nothing especially bad about this room other than the fact of its distance from college. This is compensated for, though, by its proximity to the Co-Op, ots of restaurants, Chinese food (order lots, beats the shit out of hall), the gym (very cheap) and other things.

The bicycle shed is just outside one window, and its security light lights up the room quite a lot, which can be annoying if you are nearly asleep. Jane, the housekeeper, is very friendly, and (tries to) clean the rooms every Monday morning. Watch out for her husband who can be a little grouchy, but I have only seen him once in a term and a bit. Plenty of light in the room in the daytime with 3 windows and a windowed door (permanently locked) to the adjoining conservatory, but the 150W lightbulb (in the centre in a distinctive lightshade) and the one provided desk lamp don't light the room too well at night. I would suggest bringing up one or two more lamps.\n\nThe doorbells in this house are exceptionally loud, and it will probably give you a shock the first time you hear it.\n\nIf anyone wants to come and see the room, please drop a note in my pigeon hole and I will see what I can do - Patrick Urwin.",

Bay windows give you maximum sun.\nWardrobe - not world-class, wardrobe height is a bit of an issue\nWall space - loads great for poster lovers\nCarpet - not the nicest colour\nToilets - always clean\nLighting - might want to add an extra large-sized lamp for added lighting.  Similar to most other rooms.\nHeating - Can get a bit cold in the middle of the night if you are used to warmer climes.\nWash-basin region - Good mirror, shaving ports and light, towel rack and decent sink, with a lot of extra space for washing up.\nCurtains - Decent. Good at blocking light.  \nDesk - average amount of space on desk.  Two drawers\nOther bonuses - \n-- quality computer table with space for a desktop, keyboard, and large speakers.\n-- Extra side window as well as large bay windows\n-- Proximity to the Fenners' gym, probably the closest 2nd year room you can get to it.\n\nOverall rating - 8/10 .  I would rate it 10/10 were it not for the making noise-issue and for the steep price tag you might expect better facilities (kitchen, shower).  However in some areas (size, view, sunlight) this is definitely one of the top 5 rooms available for 2nd year.",

                "Best Features": "The view! Looks over tree court (see picture) and you get the sunset in the evening. Also a good size- not too big but could do with a few more chairs to fill the space! Tons of space to put up pictures on the pinboard and also plenty of shelves!",

Most of the furniture is new. Also an inbuilt wardrobe with some hanging space and a few small draws on one side. On the other side is a sink and mirrored cabinet (the only mirror in the room ). There's some high-up cupboard space that you can keep some stuff in over the holidays though it doesn't lock so best not to leave anything valuable. Tons of pinboard space (the pinboard covers a whole wall!). 1 ceiling light and 2 lamps (1 floor lamp and 1 desk lamp).",
                "General": "This room is on the 2nd floor so you'll have to move your stuff up 2 flights of stairs when you move in, but better than 3! Very convenient location being in the centre of town. \nNot many plug sockets so bring an extension lead- 2 sockets next to the desk and 2 behind the bed (you'll have to pull the bed out a bit to plug anything into them!). The internet socket is next to the desk too which is pretty convenient (can reach it easily with a 2m ethernet cable). \nCould do with repainting in places but not too bad. The carpet is pretty new though a rather unpleasant brown colour, but you get used to it!\nIn terms of special features there's a fireplace (blocked up) with a wooden mantelpiece and also a strange archway/alcove thing in the corner next to the desk.\nGenerally, a great room which I'd definitely recommend!",

Shared with the development office and a fellow so you basically have it to yourself! 3 steps away on the landing.",
                "Heating": "Great! Big radiator behind the desk next to the window and it heats the room up pretty quickly. I find it's most effective if you tuck the curtains behind the radiator so that the heat doesn't escape straight out of the (single-glazed) windows!",
                "Natural Lighting": "OK- nice big windows which let lots off light in during the day, though can be a bit dingy at the other end of the room near he sink.

There is plenty of storage space across the two rooms.  It is also one of those rooms where you can work without being distracted, it is airy and gets lots of light and is often a more attractive prospect than the college library full of noisy freshers.",

There is a rather nice large table in a corner that would make an excellent dinning table, but it doesn't really fit in the centre of the room.  More importantly there is a sofa (college style not dfs style) and a matching chair set, and finally a pleasant dark wooden cabinet which makes for a nice place to store your sinlge malts and cut class decanter.  There is also a fire place with the college crest (badly painted) but you will have read all about that in all the other reviews so far.  The gas fire is very good but a complete health and safety risk, it is at the moment held to the wall with duct tape.  Almost forgot, there is a small fridge with a small freezer compartment, can't fit much in but you can after three years at uni finally have ice in your drinks.",
                "General": "The set is not the biggest by far in college nor is the view the nicest (but who cares about seeing Tree Court from your bedroom, you walk through it every day).  However it is one of the best rooms outside of the 'uber' sets in the Old Courts and in my opinion is certainly better decorated and furnished than either of the U staircase sets.  It doesn't have the down sides of the Old Courts; cupboards for gyp rooms shared between eight people, its too far away for people to drop in for a quick sherry before hall and leave thir gowns there after.  Overall an excellent room pushing brilliant, though I would advise looking around it before balloting if you are concerned about the noise levels.",
                "Gyp Room": "The gyp room is in a galley style, through a door in your hall, all newly done up and so looks impressive to start with.  It however is very narrow and there is limited worktop space.  The kitchen is shared with a fellow, she makes coffee and tea, which other than making toast is the only thing you can really do in there, and isn't around in the evening.  As a result you have a gyp room to yourslef which no one else can access but you can't really do much with it.  Also no fridge in here, but there is one in your hallway.",

You get used to the noise after a while and I haven't had any problems sleeping.  The bells all bloody Sunday however are a different matter,  I can't think of a better reason for the invention of ASBOs than to deal with gung ho campanologists going at it on a Sunday morning (the tune is awful as well).  These are a lot more annoying than McDonalds.",
                "Worst Features": "There is nothing terribly bad about the room, just minor annoyances.  The dinner table you can't eat around, the gyp room which you can't really cook in.  The room is also a bit sparse without decoration, and the noise would most likely be a problem for a light sleeper.  I don't think that there is anything worng personally but others may prefer a bigger set or closer showers.",

As such, I found it necessary to bring supplementary furniture, such as a small set of drawers for clothes and another arm chair. The room has a pretty poor hanging electrical light which doesn't provide much assistance at night time so I brought up a standing lamp to supplement it. There is also a good desk lamp to work by.

Windows are also thin so noise comes straight in from the streets which is annoying when the local schools finish on weekday afternoons. While there is a church nearby, you can't hear its bells unless the wind is going in the wrong (right?) direction. Old pipe work in the house means that when the boiler is on, you can hear water flowing through the house which is a quite disconcerting sound early in the morning.",

                "Bathroom": "The bathroom is shared between the 6 people on the staircase (though as mentioned, the drain for the shower runs through the gyp room so you can make your breakfast and know when the person upstairs has finished). If you are that desperate you could use the wooden framed jobbies, or even the baths, in the basement.\n\nIt is like many older Caius bathrooms mould trying to grow everywhere and peeling paint though nothing truly terrible (most of it went away when we got a replacement bedder for a week). Shower curtain and bath mat are changed reasonably regularly.\n\nThe toilet is separate and has no sinks - so you'll have to use the ones in your room if someone is in the bathroom. The issue with the toilet is the wooden floor, which was black until the bedder was asked to do some cleaning and is now no longer entirely black. The area round the toilet seems to be showing some signs of many years of drunken/incompetent misses.",
                "Best Features": "Good sized room with the ability to combine with the room next door. Generally a very pleasant room.\n\nGyp room shared between 2. Bathroom not in basement. Quiet room facing St. Mikes (see bell comment in noise section).",
                "Furniture": "There are 2 desk lamps, 1 coffee table, 2 (though soon to be 1) normal (not mini) fridges, 1 small bookcase, 2 desks, 2 chests of drawers, 1 freestanding wardrobe, 1 double built in wardrobe, 1 large storage cupboard above the wardrobe, 2 large pin boards (one per room), 1 large white board, 2 bedside tables (one old and knackered, one brand new, 1 freestanding tall lamp thing and an (un)comfy chair. The carpet has a very large number of stains on.\n\nThere are picture rails all the way round the larger room, though none in the smaller room. There is however a print of some landscape above the mantlepiece in the smaller room.",
                "General": "There are 16 (I think) plug sockets around the two rooms so there shouldn't be any need for more - the only issue is that there are only 4 behind the desk but that is hardly bad.\n\nWas recently redecorated to put the sink back in and remove the useful, wall-mounted bookshelves in the smaller room. The shaver light, mirror, splash protector and sink all don't line up and there is a mess where they ripped the neat wooden box housing the piping ends out (when they didn't need to). Wall paint is generally fine except for above the fireplace where someone put some massive nails in the wall. At the beginning of the year there was a lot of brown residue to remove from the walls which wasn't too nice - it shouldn't be there now.",
                "Gyp Room": "This is potentially one of the best features of the room. Not due to you only sharing it with one other person but because it allows you to join the two rooms into a sort of mega-set thing with the 4 rooms joined by the gyp room. None of the other rooms on the staircase can do this.\n\nThe gyp room itself is laughable and aside from having more pipework than your average pumping station, is badly laid out for the tiny space. The giant cupboards take up most of the room, without actually providing any practical work surfaces. Lots of storage space though quite a lot of it is filled with unnecessary cleaning rubbish that isn't used and spare appliances, e.g. another kettle and some \"non-poisonous enamel paint\" (also, good luck to anyone below 6' in trying to use the top shelf of the cupboards - oh and ffs don't look above the cupboards you can see the never-cleaned vent system). There is no proper sealed fire door between the gyp-room and the main room so be prepared for a smelly room for a while if you burn anything.\n\nThe microwave door will hit you in the face if you don't stop it swinging open. Food preparation is probably best done by resting a chopping board on the corner of the sink. That brings us to the sink, which is a triumph of marvelous design. The mixer tap only just reaches over the side of the wooden surround and so soaks this surround every time you use it. This is fine while the draining board is new and oiled as it is currently but the last one had a colony of mould growing out of it that had been there so long that it had developed bleach and heat resistance (though did turn green when it regrew after bleaching). The sink itself is one of the ones you find in chemistry labs from the 1950s, though significantly more knackered. While usefully big, trying to swill stuff at the far end down the drain is frustrating as the tap is next to the plug hole.",
                "Heating": "Possibly one of the worst features of the room. The college seemed to neglect to turn the heating in the smaller room on for several months though now this is fine - the one radiator in a relatively small room is sufficient.\n\nHowever, the main room does not have central heating, requiring you to manually control the electric fire mounted on the wall (even though this room is, and even when a single room was, rental charged as if it has full central heating).\n\nWhat with the drafts from the corridor if the windows there blow open (they don't latch shut), the single glazing (the curtains sometimes move) and the vent in the fireplace the main room will quickly get cold. Indeed, the main body of the room can be sweltering yet the desk area be very cold. I have had days where the main room at 21&#730;C and by the window was only around 10&#730;C. I guess there are many solutions to this such as moving the desks, wearing thicker socks, shoving blu tack or duct tape over all the window gaps or simply manning up.",
                "Natural Lighting": "The larger room is well lit during the day, though as it is quite deep the light may not quite reach the parts further back. \n\nThe mini hallwayjoiningroom thing has no windows and so is quite dim but has its own light. The gyp room has windows but they look onto the staircase so generally don't help much - though do mean that light from the eternally on corridor lights does spill in at night (only a problem if you have your bed in the position shown in the photos and can be sorted by shutting one of the doors).\n\nThe smaller room suffers from being on only the first floor, looking over rose crescent (though the windows are frosted so don't worry about the people opposite's prying eyes - F3 has some clear panes). Generally it won't get very light at all.\n\nThough not natural lighting related, light switch lovers can rejoice at having no fewer than four to play with.",
                "Noise Level": "I find that the bells can be quite ANNOYING. Unlike F3, this room has a direct line of sight to Great St. Mary's bell tower (the ringing seems louder in this room). Some people probably won't notice them - they only raise the ambient noise level (very quiet) by around 10-15 dB but are very frequent. Take a look at the Cambridge Youth's ringing calendar to see if you can stomach the up to 6 hours of repetitive pealing a day.\n\nHowever, when the bells aren't ringing, this room is blissfully quiet - only the occasional hum from the workshop's large machine thing below. Obviously the big room is single glazed so if people are playing around in the court below you can hear but this really isn't an issue.\n\nThe bells can't be heard from the smaller room though there is the issue that Rose crescent can get quite noisy late at night. The secondary glazing (funny second window frame behind the first for those who are confused) alleviates most of the noise, meaning that only the occasional drunken yelp of someone having a boxing match with a stone wall or similar gets through.",
                "Worst Features": "The front door is far from secure - could probably easily be opened from the outside. If you don't trust your neighbour in F3 you'll have to lock the gyp room door too.\n\nConstant nagging room envy that F3 is so much bigger than yours (and has better carpet), though F4 is plenty big enough for most purposes (look elsewhere if you want to try caber tossing or indoor hang gliding).\n\nThis year, the St. Mike's electricity supply has been very faulty - which has meant no lights or heating for several hours at a time. This should be sorted now.\n\nThe room is relatively narrow (not compared with rooms elsewhere in college, just compared to its length and F3), which can make furniture arranging difficult. Can look a little barren if you don't fill the rooms with stuff.\n\nDust will accumulate on any horizontal surface very quickly. There are also a number of random pipes which are not attached to anything all over the place.",

Electrical heater in the study has a timer on it which is annoying but not a major issue. Bring plenty of your own lighting as the study is too big for a single energy-saving lightbulb to cope.",

On the plus side there are 2 girls toilets and 1 shower between just 3 of us (although that will vary depending on how many girls live on the staircase.  One of the toilets and the shower are in a bit which you need a code to get into, and it also has 2 sinks, a big mirror and some plugs so handy for doing your hair or whatever.  This bit is nicer than the rest of the general basement area as it has a sort of laminate floor instead of just stone.  The toilet in this bit is better than the other one.  The shower is quite nice really, its got pale green tiles and the grout is clean and not mouldy or anything and the bathroom bit seems to get cleaned regularly.  The shower is quite powerful but the temperature can be a bit dodgy, either really hot or takes ages to get hot water, but once you've got it to the right temperature its usually fine.  Apart from the distance its probably the best shower I've had compared to HC/Morty road.  There is a staffroom in the same basement as well, which means there\u00c2\u2019s often a lot of men going past the bathroom, so the area is not very private.",
                "Best Features": "The fireplaces have some nice cresty details, the sofa as previously mentioned is pretty good.  It has nice high ceilings and the windows are pretty (although they let all the heat out) and I've got a nice view down Trinity Street.  Having a sink is good as not all the rooms in this staircase do.  Plenty of furniture.  Has a little porch bit aswell with 2 doors leading into the two rooms.",
                "Furniture": "Bedroom has a single bed (although at the minute i've put that into the living room bit for TV watching convenience), sink with a light over it which you can also charge a toothbrush/razor off when its on (tie something to the end of the string to pull as the string is a bit manky), chest of drawers and big set of shelves.  It also has a weird wardrobe.  The wardrobe rail runs from front to back and is very small but does pull out.  Half of the wardrobe is little shelves with some quaint little labels saying things like 'pyjamas' and 'collars' and 'handkerchiefs'.  I would say the wardrobe is more suited to boys/the olden days but its ok, and there is lots of room in the drawers.  The handle on the wardrobe is also broken.  There is a big window with a deep windowsill that you can put stuff on and a fireplace (blocked up) with a little ledge on top of it.  There is a little sort of medicine cupboard by the sink which annoyingly doesn't close but is quite useful for toiletries.  There's a radiator and one plug point (but it is brand new as I had to get it replaced this year), well 2 but one is blocked off by a pipe.  In the living room there is a decent sized desk with lots of drawers, a coffee table, a sort of slightly higher side table with a shelf under it, an armchair quite a comfy one, better than the standard green/wood beauties, although very low and you need a throw for it as its dirty looking.  There is a cabinet with shelves in which is roomy and good for putting a TV on top of.  There is a fireplace in this room aswell with an electric heater on it.  This is quite effective once it's been on a while but takes ages to warm the room up.  The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is the sofa.  Its pretty big and fairly comfy, although a bit narrow.  Again get a throw as the colour/fabric leaves a lot to be desired.  All in all plenty of storage and some good comfy furniture.  4 or 5 plug points in living room.",
                "General": "The bedroom gets quite a lot of sunlight as the window is almost the whole length of the room.  The windows in the living room are smaller but they are on two walls of the corner.  The bedder is very nice and she empties the bin every weekday and cleans the sink and hoovers on a Thursday.  She doesn't come in too early, usually between 10 and 12, and if you put the bin in the porchy bit or living room then you won't be disturbed when she comes in.  The decor is just sort of cream and the curtains are dark green and burgundy stripes, a bit gloomy but keep the light out.  The rooms and porch bit are all carpeted in a sort of browny colour.  Overall I would say there is plenty of space and furniture and some nice features, especially the curly window handles and fireplace details.  Nothing major to fault with the room, and its a lot quieter than the rooms looking over Rose Crescent.",

                "Best Features": "The view! It's a brilliant view of Tree Court and you can people-watch all day, and I often lean out the window and have chats with people. I love this room, it's really cosy and comfortable, whilst also being a really decent size and having all the furniture I need. It's great being the only student on the floor, cos this makes it quiet (especially as the Fellows only have offices and don't live here) and the next door room on this floor and room next door on the next staircase are pracitically never used.",
                "Furniture": "MASSIVE desk cos it's acutally a very large extendable dining table, so can serve two purposes, and size can be adjusted accordingly. Cool wheely office chair, chest of drawers, two wardrobes (one stand-alone and the other built-in wardrobe with sink), two comfy chairs, coffee table, and filing cabinet (I guess to make up for the lack of drawers with the 'desk'). One wall is a cream painted notice-board with shelves - so plenty of shelf space, which is very useful.",
                "General": "Lovely light room, sunlight shines in in the late afternoon, but it's always bright. The radiator is brilliant, so it's never cold and the bedder is really really lovely. Nice big size. Living so close to the porters is not a problem at all, they've never complained about noise (and I'm a music student!) and it's nice cos you get to know them well. I love this room, it's so convenient being in Tree Court and the view never gets old, I would definitely recommend it!",
                "Gyp Room": "Next door to the room, so conveniently close. As with most of Tree Court gyp rooms, it's really small, but as I'm the only student on this floor, it's only shared with one fellow who occasionally makes tea. So lots of cupboard space and I mainly have it to myself! Tiny fridge, but then again I'm the only one using it. (I had to bring my own fridge, but maybe I just eat a lot).",

So not too far away, especially relative to how far is it for the rest of the staircase! The toilets are in the basement too, and they are in a better state than the bathroom, which looks like somebody must have been murdered there. There are two showers and and baths, although only one of the showers actually works. The baths look like they haven't been used/cleaned since the said murder. Despite everything, the shower is rather powerful and you get your privacy. I don't know about the boys showers.",
                "Best Features": "Four rooms all for yourself - so much space (including a tiny tiny hall which is great because you actually have a separate place to put your shoes and coats)! Beautiful light and a nice peaceful view of St Mike\u00b4s court from the study. Separate gyp room with own fridge is great, as your food wont get stolen and you can leave your dishes unwashed for as long as you please (although the bedder sometime washes them - he is very nice too).",
                "Furniture": "The study has two large desks, one office chair, one normal chair, one bookcase, one coffee table and two relatively comfortable blue armchairs. The sofa from last year disappeared somewhere unfortunately... The bedroom has a bed (which is difficult to place somewhere because the bedroom is very weirdly shaped), a small sink with a mirror, and big chest of drawers, a new wardrobe with a few drawers and a matching bedside chest of drawers. No internet in the bedroom, but electrical sockets are reasonably located.",
                "General": "The only thing this place is missing is en-suite. I loved living here for its amazing centre-of-town location, laundry room right in the basement of this staircase, old-school feel (two collage-crested fireplaces) and the abundance of space.",
                "Gyp Room": "A very very small gyp room is a part of this suite. Its basically a walk-in cupboard, but there is a small window, so despite its size it feels ok. There is a large sink, a small fridge, a microwave oven, a new kettle and a minimum of working space. Lots of shelves though.",

                "Worst Features": "Noise in the bedroom, and lack of proper natural light. That is probably the only bad thing - sharing the bathroom in the basement proved to be much less of a nightmare than I had expected.",

                "Bathroom": "There isn't a bathroom as such - instead for men there is a room with three showers and two baths and a further room with two extra showers in the basement. There is also a room for women with a similar number of showers and baths I think but I have never seen them. There is also one unisex toilet, one male toilet and one female toilet in this end of the basement (it stretches across multiple staircases) and others further down.\n\nAs far as sharing goes, you can't leave your stuff down there for obvious reasons but as there are so many facilities you hardly ever encounter anyone else and I have never had to wait to go to the bathroom or use the shower. The showers themselves are nice and hot and very powerful so excellent for waking you up in the morning, and the baths are kept in good condition.\n\nThe main issue people have with the showers and toilets is that they are in the basement, and as C7 is on the top floor that means going down 4 flights of stairs whenever you need to use them. You do get used to it, but it is best to try and go when you get in to the staircase or before you leave somewhere to save yourself any unnecessary trips. This can easily be a sticking point if you don't like stairs.",
                "Best Features": "Having two big rooms is fantastic. The bedroom is probably the same size as an SHB room and the main room is maybe 1.5 times the size or over. Being able to separate the social/work area and the sleeping are is great and it is the main feature I am going to miss next year.\n\nIn each room, although now boarded up there is a fireplace and mantlepiece with the Gonville and Caius crest on. Although not pained in like in some other rooms, they still look really nice and give the set a lot of character.\n\nHaving a private gyp, though small, is also really nice. Again it is something I will miss next year.\n\nThe general charm of the set. It is in the old part of St Mike's so it has a lot of quirks - as it is at the top both rooms are quite oddly shaped for example, and in a way it feels antique.",
                "Furniture": "In the two rooms, unless things are changed around over summer, there are:\n\nTwo comfy chairs (one is comfier than the other, which I had to nag housekeeping for about a month before they gave to me as when I arrived there was only one)\nA good swivel desk chair\nTwo desks - one nice old one with drawers and another without drawers that is similar to the SHB desks, and bigger than the older one\nTwo small coffee tables\nA decent bookcase\nA SMALL fridge\nTwo desk lights (one of which I use as a bedside light)\nA bedside table\nTwo bins - a small one for the main room and a large one for the kitchen\nA bed\nA wardrobe\nA small chest of drawers\n\nAlso, it doesn't technically fit under furniture but there is a small basin in the bedroom.",
                "General": "There are a good number of sockets around so you should be fine from that respect. The ethernet socket is by one of the two windows in the main room and where the desk currently sits which is good.\n\nBeing in the centre of town and thirty seconds from college is wonderful.\n\nAs it is on the top floor, if you don't know anyone on the staircase it can get quite lonely up here. That is, unless you like the solitude.\n\nAgain, a few of the nice features are: your own gyp, a basin in the bedroom and nice Gonville & Caius crests on the fireplaces.\n\nAll in all, I love this set and am going to be very sad to leave it. I've put lots of photos of it up for you to get a good look at (it doesn't look quite right though as I'm in the middle of packing!) and if you want to have a look please feel free to contact me to have a nose around. My CRSid is pth24 (please note this review was written in Lent 2013 and I will be vacating the room at the end of Easter 2013).",
                "Gyp Room": "The gyp room is always a bit of a talking point. It is tiny (about the size of a wardrobe) but it is YOURS AND YOURS ALONE. The gyp is actually inside the set - you walk through the main door and there's the living room to your right, the bedroom in front of you and the gyp to your left - so is very private.\n\nThe gyp doesn't have a George Foreman because it would be a fire risk as the place is so small, but it does have a combi microwave and a toaster which have done me well. There is plenty of drying space, enough cupboard space for one person (although some of it is quite high so shorter people might not be able to use all of it) and, although there isn't any decent work surface, the spare desk in the main room I have found works just fine.\n\nAlthough it is small, it is brilliant having it to yourself. You can leave washing up in the sink for days if needed, all the cupboard space is yours and you don't have to worry about other people eating your food or using your crockery.",
                "Heating": "Again, this is variable. The main room is fine for heating - it has an electric heater which can only be put on for a maximum of two hours at a time so you need to remember to keep putting it on (I often put it on when I go to lectures/supervisions so the room is nice and toasty when I get back) but if you do remember it can get very warm in there quite quickly. Without the heater on, it's not that cold except on the coldest days of Lent term - then you really need to remember to keep the heater on otherwise it gets quite nippy.\n\nThe bedroom is not as warm as the main room. The boiler in the basement, which heats the small radiator in there, was replaced at the end of Michaelmas in 2012 but it doesn't seem to do that good a job. As the water needs to be piped up 4 flights of stairs to get to the room it loses some of its heat and pressure, meaning the radiator isn't hot enough to heat the room to a suitable standard during winter. However, I had it bled by maintenance once and it got better be the answer.\n\nBecause the bedroom can get a bit cold in winter and the electric heater in the main room turns off after two hours, whichever room you sleep in you will probably get slightly cold during the night so make sure you wrap up warm.",
                "Natural Lighting": "The natural light is lovely. The living room that faces onto St Mike's faces south so on nice days you get loads of sun through the two windows (and beautiful views of King's chapel too). I often actually have to close the curtains between around 1pm to 4pm or so because the sunlight streams through the windows and, because they are panelled, it creates a grid-like shadow pattern on the desk which is quite distracting while trying to work! Apart from that though, lots of light in the main room.\n\nThe bedroom is a lot darker as it faces north and straight onto Rose Crescent so the sun can't get directly in the window. It is light enough in the morning but expect it to be quite a dark room for most of the day.\n\nFinally, in the very small 'hall' there is a skylight making it very bright in the morning during the day.",
                "Noise Level": "The noise level can be variable, but I don't notice it too much.\n\nThe living room (one that faces onto St Mike's) is never terribly noisy, the worst it gets is when the outside porters are doing some heavy work in the court. You can hear people coming and going on the staircase quite easily but I've never found that an issue.\n\nThe bedroom can be louder as it faces onto Rose Crescent. Although the window in there is double glazed to reduce the noise, on a Friday/Saturday night it can get a bit noisy with people out on the town. I can cope with it but if you sleep lightly you might have some trouble.",
                "Worst Features": "Going down 4 flights of stairs to go to the loo (although you do get used to it and it is great for procrastinating).\n\nThe cold in the winter if the heater isn't on.\n\nNoise from Rose Crescent and generally from town\n\nThe odd shape of the rooms made it hard to find a good place for the furniture that didn't look cumbersome.",

                "Bathroom": "The bathroom is an odd situation so I will do my best to explain.\n\nBetween staircases C-F there is a long basement corridor that connects all the staircases and, in this corridor, there is a multitude of WCs, and rooms containing baths and showers (mostly designated male or female).\n\nHowever, to put this more plainly, these rooms do often contain multiple showers and baths and the idea of this takes some getting used to! Effectively, at the bottom of the staircase in the basement, there is a unisex toilet and near this there is the nearest shower/bath room that contains 3 showers and 2 baths. To give you an idea of the layout, the showers are together on the right and are partitioned, though with what I like to call 'censor-strip' doors.\n\nThe baths are on the left and are fully partitioned off from the room with their own full-length doors.\n\nThis bathroom is a bit grotty but has become slightly nicer after requesting the bedders clean it... it is most certainly bearable. If you like bathing, the baths are highly recommend due to their huge depth and rapid filling rate.\n\nThe biggest downside from this configuration is that you have an effective distance of four floors to travel to get to the bathroom or a toilet (3 to ground level, 1 to basement) - on the upside, you will rapidly become very fit. Try to learn to use the toilet on the way in or out of the building or, alternatively, urinate straight out onto the people of Rose Crescent from the balcony (small gutter with some precarious room to stand in if you have good balance and no fear).",

                "General": "Plenty of sockets, just make sure you have a 2m extension lead for the desk area.\n\nInternet sockets are only available in the room overlooking St. Mike's and there is only intermittent wireless access (don't count on it even still being here when you arrive).\n\nRoom perhaps painted in the last few years but carpet is older than me. Bed is only 2 years old though so it should stand up to a fair beating. Wardrobe and drawers new. One desk old but reliable, one new and slightly broken (probably avoid trying to move it).",
                "Gyp Room": "The kitchen is en suite and is all yours, behind your lockable front door.\n\nUnfortunately, this is appallingly small (floor space about 1x1m). It contains a large cupboard, a shelf with a toaster and a kettle, a grotty (but spacious) sink and wooden draining area and a microwave with oven function (again granted after complaining to college).\n\nPlease be aware that there is NO counter or preparation area in this gyp room (microwave is on a shelf) and do not be under any illusion that these shelves have spare room for preparation. However, I have been very happy using the spare big desk to prepare my food so it hasn't really affected me.\n\nThe large fridge which comes with the room does not live in here but instead lives in the room looking out onto St. Mike's.",
                "Heating": "The room on the Rose Crescent side is centrally heated 24/7 which is absolutely fine (after I complained the college to get them to fix it...).\n\nThe other room has an SHB-style electric radiator with a timer for 30, 60 or 120 minutes, so this room can get a little cold at night if you choose to sleep in this room.",
                "Natural Lighting": "Natural light if perfectly sufficient in both of the rooms. Also, it is nice that one room gets light in the morning and one doesn't, so you can put the bed in the room most appropriate to you (if you like being woken up by light etc.)",
                "Noise Level": "The room backing out onto Rose Crescent does suffer from the noise of drunken louts at night, mostly on Friday and Saturday evenings - this is less pronounced but slightly apparent from tourists during the day. The room looking out onto St. Mike's court suffers only from the noise of the St. Mary's church bells which ring intermittently on Sunday.",
                "Worst Features": "The small size of the gyp room.\n\nThe four-floor trek to bathroom facilities.\n\nThe fridge is quite loud and sounds like it may be on its last legs.\n\nSlightly limited storage space for clothes.\n\nBedders are generally not brilliant (I complained and, whilst they got a little better, they became generally unhappy because of it, so try not to rub them up the wrong way on your tenure. On the other hand, if somebody complains again you'll probably get new bedders.)",

Or it was suggested to me that I should rig up a funnel and hose contraption which travels down the stairwell into the bathroom in the basement. Neither of which I have tried. On the plus side the treck up the stairs has given me nicely toned butt cheeks. The showers (mens) are functional. They are in the basement and each cubicle has a \u00c2\u2018hacienda\u00c2\u2019 style door which covers from the chest to the shins.

My favourite room so far and I have had an enormous room at St Pauls and a nice en suite in SHB so its damn nice despite petty annoyances. Nice homely feel and a great room to spend your final year. I would recommend this room to anyone who wants a quiet typically Cambridge room with a stunning view and just missed out on the best tree court rooms. Rooms around here only went around 100/110 or so in the ballot this year. I was about 50 and don\u00c2\u2019t regret my decision so could be a bit of a steal for someone.",

The window in there doesn\u00c2\u2019t open. Provided with sink, fridge, two slice toaster and kettle. Oh and a 100 year old cupboard which you have to slide to open. It contains a weird Bunsen burner type hob thing which would probably work if you connected it to a butane canister but I\u00c2\u2019m not sure what Russ would say about that.",
                "Heating": "Electric heater in front room is POTENT, can heat up the room in about 10 minutes. Radiator in back room is pretty broken and makes watery glugging noise so I have to put my electric heater on in my front room and let convection do its best in heating both rooms. This can sometimes create a slightly strange heat gradient throughout the set but its fine.",

There are some drawers as well as cupboard space. The amount of workspace is quite limited. The George Foreman sits on the worktop underneath a cupboard (as does the kettle and the toaster) so that the top plate can't be lifted fully. The microwave sits above the draining board on this funny metal platform and is at eye height (for me, I'm 164 cm) which isn't ideal. College fitted a new wooden draining board this year due to the last one going mouldy - make sure to keep it dry or oiled otherwise it will go mouldy too. There is no fridge in the kitchen - instead, you get your own fridge in your room.",
                "Heating": "There is a radiator in the bedroom that is controlled by central heating. There is an electric heater fixed onto the wall in the living room which you can turn on for either 1/2, 1, or 2 hours by pressing a button on the little box next to the heater. There is also a dial to control the temperature. The heating in both rooms seems to be quite effective (if you remember to press the button for the living room heating...), although the bedroom sometimes gets a little cold at the awkward time of year when college thinks it's warm enough to reduce the hours of heating when actually it's still rather chilly...",
                "Natural Lighting": "The living room has 3 windows all on the same wall (facing St. Mike's court). They let in a reasonable amount of light; the sun can be a little blinding in the early afternoon. The bedroom has a smaller window (overlooking Rose Crescent) that doesn't let in all that much light; I often find I use the light during the day in that room. The little entranceway doesn't have any windows nor does the gyp room.",
                "Noise Level": "The bedroom overlooks Rose Crescent which can get noisy at night, especially at weekends. The living room overlooks St. Mike's court which is usually fine, but you can hear the bells from Gt. St. Mary's church which ring quite frequently at the weekend.",
                "Worst Features": "The gyp room could be much improved if college refitted it. As it stands, it's a bit rubbish... You get used to using it though. The noise at night doesn't particularly bother me because if I want to sleep, I'll fall asleep within seconds and not wake up again, but I can imagine the noise would bother some people. Sharing the shower with at least 5 other people can be a little annoying if most of the people living on the staircase need to be up for 9 am lectures (it's quite competitive to get early morning showers).",

                "Furniture": "Two lamps, a nice big old desk as well as a modern Ikea style one, coffee table, big chest of drawers in the bedroom as well as an inbuilt wardrobe and overhead storage area. Big fridge and little fridge, several shelving areas across both rooms, and the best bit, a big under eave storage area in the living room. More storage space than one would require, and the furniture provided is decent. Sink in the bedroom which is annoying to have to wash up in, but good to have.",
                "General": "Some nice touches, like Caius crest fireplaces, and that weird storage area with a archer's window. Would recommend this room if you get a pair of ear plugs.",
                "Gyp Room": "Own tiny gyp room with a toaster, kettle and microwave. A G-form appeared in there after Michaelmas as well which is nice. Unfeasibly small, and the slightest thing sets the alarm off. Burning toast or spraying a deodorant too liberally in the bedroom, at your peril. Alarms are terrifying. Ideal to have your own gyp room, makes the room feel like a self-contained flat. Just no haute cuisine meals. But then this is Caius' cooking facilities after all.",
                "Heating": "Electric heater in living room is fantastic, throws out plenty of heat and is rapid to start doing so. Keeps the room lovely and toasty. Bedroom has a radiator which thus far hasn't worked, but the room doesn't get cold. Maybe a slight draught from the window but overall no issues.",
                "Natural Lighting": "Lovely window looking out on to St. Mike's court, provides a great view and enough light. Not a massively light and airy room, but not dingy either. Bedroom window is good. Although neither window actually shuts properly which isn't ideal.",
                "Noise Level": "Worst thing about the room. Not sure about previous reviews, but despite being a heavy sleeper am regularly woken up/kept awake by drunken yells and one particular busker who on Fridays and Saturdays has been known to play until 5 in the morning.

There is only a shower, although there is a bath hidden somewhere in the other shower room in the basement (4 floors down). The bathroom is unheated and vented to the staircase so gets pretty cold, but I have been told to man up. The shower is decent enough and always hot, though the cubicle is a bit cramped.",
                "Best Features": "View! The view is amazing, and you can see wonderful sunsets over King's Chapel and Caius tower. The rooms are also big, and there is a lot of storage (including a curious cupboard with a window at one end that is lockable). You basically have your own little flat and the bathroom is just below. Very nice and private, with lots of space for entertaining and spreading out lots of stuff.",
                "Furniture": "There is lots of furniture in this room currently as everything is still doubled from when it was a split set (they might remove some/change it). However, currently: small room has bed, bedside drawers and reading lamp, big built in wardrobe with lots of hanging space/shelves, big chest of drawers that is doddery but functional, big big sink. Big room: big ancient wooden desk that is wonderful for working space but you can't get a chair under it as there are drawers on either side. Desk chair (standard), easy chair (pretty hard but standard), 2 smallish bookcases, coffee table, free-standing wardrobe useful for coats, other small desk used as a table, 2 fridges (one big, one small), other small chest of drawers, desk lamp and main light. You might want another  lamp to light the darker corner.",
                "General": "Lots of sockets, though in places which means there are limited room arrangements. Carpet is a boring but standard beige. Paintwork is generally ok though some bits of plaster fall off occasionally. Location is great, right opposite college but a bit more private with no tourists coming in; you can do a Sainsbury's round trip in ten minutes and it's close to almost anywhere you'll have lectures (<10 mins to Sidgewick site, ~3 to New Museums). Again: the view is amazing, and it's lovely being up under the eaves. A really nice welcoming room, and very nice having a separate bedroom to escape from work to.

                "Gyp Room": "Own kitchen! It is within the set, which is very convenient. However, it is very, very small, just about big enough to stand in, and there is no sink or George Foreman. It does have a toaster (which even if you burnt it a tiny bit will set off all the alarms), kettle, and microwave/combi oven. The sink in the bedroom is now big enough to wash up in, or else you can use the communal gyp room downstairs. Plenty of storage space in cupboards. Not much worktop space but I use the spare table in the room.",
                "Heating": "Bedroom: central heating, very effective although the times it is on are somewhat sporadic. Big room: electric heater with boost button (max 2h). The heater is only just about big enough to heat the room, and the windows are VERY drafty (no secondary glazing) so with the desk in the window (for light) you can have a warm back but freezing legs/face from the arctic gales coming through the (shut) windows. Bring blankets. Even if the room is boiling, once the heater goes off it cools very quickly as there is probably no insulation in the roof and the windows are very drafty.",
                "Natural Lighting": "Bedroom: reasonable amount. Big room: not bad, window is at one side so half the room gets a bit dark. With the light on however it is fine, and the afternoons are lovely and light (facing west). The sloping ceilings in both rooms make it a bit dark.",
                "Noise Level": "Main room - almost silent, a bit of noise from Trinity Street but hardly anything except from noisy Caians in the courtyard. Bedroom: secondary glazing is very good and it's pretty high up, but still a bit of noise from Rose Crescent/the market place. Rarely bad enough to stop sleep though. Bedroom is also blissfully shielded from the Great St Mary's bells... (these are loud in the big room).",
                "Worst Features": "Very cold. If you are an arts student sitting at your desk all day, you will need a blanket round you even with the heater on. Maybe one day college will put secondary glazing in the big room... It is also pretty high up (6 flights of stairs) for moving in, and the kitchen is titchy (but functional). Sloping ceilings make the rooms feel a bit smaller than the equivalent rooms below, but also add a lot of character.",

If windows are shut it's not really an issue, but when it gets hot and you open them, you can hear pretty much everything.

The shower in the wet room is awesome if a little mouldy in the corners (nothing to worry about..), but the shower attachment on the bath doesn't reach high enough to actually be used. Shower and toilet are shared by between 4 and 6 people (again, depending whether people in G staircase share or not). Never had to wait to use anything though.",
                "Best Features": "The bedroom looks out onto St Mikes court which is very pretty, and the living room looks out onto market square - good for people watching and you get a prime spot if the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge ever come back and visit the Guildhall! Also the living room is huge and you won't be short of storage space, which is good if you want to leave things hidden over the holidays. This floor connects to G staircase which is good for having all your friends around :)",

There is a light above the sink as well as a main light in the room and a desk light, and there is a plug socket by the bed.\nLiving Room: 2 desks (one old with drawers, one new), 1 coffee table, 1 extra set of drawers, 1 thing with cupboards and shelves on it, 1 built-in wardrobe (huge), 1 desk chair (practically brand new and very comfy), 1 other chair. There is a main light in the room as well as a small desk light. There are also 2 pinboards, one enormous one over the fireplace and another smaller one on the opposite wall.",
                "General": "Loads of sockets in the living room, wired internet. Decoration is not too shabby (lovely yellow walls) and the carpet hides all stains, though not sure if this is a good or bad thing. It should be noted that this is a split set, so the bedroom and living room are across a corridor. This may initially seem annoying but it's actually not a problem at all, you barely use the bedroom except for sleeping so it doesn't matter that it's not directly connected. Also the location cannot be beaten.",
                "Gyp Room": "The kitchen is average - shared with supposedly 4 people though some people from G staircase may also use it as this floor connects the two staircases.  Kitchen has the standard 2 fridges, 2 microwaves, a kettle, a toaster and a George Foreman. The countertop by the sink is wooden, rotting, and pretty gross. Lots of cupboard space for everyone though :)",
                "Heating": "The bedroom has a radiator connected to the central heating, but somehow even when I turn this off the room is very warm and cosy (I think the heater in the bathroom also heats up this bedroom through the wall). The living room has an electric heater with a timer, so it can be put on for 2 hours at a time. This is really efficient and the room heats up very fast!",

                "Noise Level": "Bedroom is super quiet, but the living room does get a bit of noise from market square and all the buskers. This generally isn't too bad, but can be a little distracting when you have a monotone Russian busker set up with a small keyboard outside your window ruining 'Make Me Feel Your Love' for an entire day. The whole building is sort of a sound trap and walls are paper thin, so you can hear people running up and down the stairs, using the kitchen, talking down the corridor etc, but again this isn't too bad. The most annoying thing is the church bells which ring ALL DAY on Sunday starting at about 8am.",
                "Worst Features": "The corridor connects to G staircase which means people will traipse up and down the corridor making noise while you are trying to sleep (corridor seems to trap all sound). It's kinda high up which means moving your stuff in and out is lots of effort.",

                "Furniture": "Bed, desk with drawers, two lamps, desk chair, two wooden chairs, coffee table, large wardrobe with shelves, bookcase with three huge shelves, cupboard with drawers, big wardrobe with several shelves and a very big sort of sideboard with four little cupboards.  Storage is definitely not a problem, but the room doesn't feel over-stocked with stuff.",
                "General": "The decor is uninspiring - white walls, white door, green carpet - but you can easily jazz it up, and you get a big pinboard for pictures etc.  There are 2 double plug sockets in convenient places but I still have a multiplug.  I liked this room enough to ballot for it two years' running, so it must be doing something right.",

The room is also part way along a corridor, so you can hear people walking up and down because the house is quite echoey.",
                "Worst Features": "Probably the noise from within the house, but if you're not a light sleeper or if you generally do your work in the library then the thin walls/piano playing won't be a problem.",

            {
                "Bathroom": "We have two showers and two toilets on the ground floor. This year, that meant two between four, since there was someone living in the guest room, but next year it will probably mean two between three. \n\nThe showers are pretty great - one is better than the other, and one shower room has a heated towel rail.",
                "Best Features": "The shutters and sash windows. Dream come true, though one is painted shut. Also the soundtrack to your life becomes filled with birdsong. And there is a cat that wanders up and down the veranda outside.",
                "Furniture": "Two comfy(ish) chairs, desk, desk chair, bed, bedside table, coffee table, chest of drawers, bookshelves, wardrobe (with more drawers). One drawer doesn't work, but all the furniture is new this year, so it's in good nick. \n\nK4 is also home to a fully wood-panelled wall, complete with boarded-up fireplace, extra shelves and cupboards, mantelpiece and weird swirly bird carvings inset. So pretty. \n\nDesk lamp is provided, you'll have to bring your own bedside lamp. The overhead light is also present, but not the best. You might be as well to also bring a standing lamp, for dark evenings.\n\nThe room has a full-length mirror.",
                "General": "K Block is a lovely place to live - it has the right combination of being close to town without the noise issues - as long as you pick the right room in K Block.",
                "Gyp Room": "The kitchen is shared between three rooms, the guest room and two fellows' offices. The fellows very rarely use it. It is an okay size, as Caius goes, and conveniently has the washing machine and dryer for K Block in it. \n\nIt has the usual stuff - fridge, kettle, toaster, microwave - but no grill.",
                "Heating": "The radiator is seriously not adequate to heat the room. I have two storage heaters on top of the radiator, which I only managed to get (and then sneakily held onto) when the heating broke during the snowy period in January. \n\nEven now in April the room is cold if the sun hasn't been shining during the day. The windows are old, and no curtains mean no insulation. You will sleep with many many blankets.",
                "Natural Lighting": "The room is south-facing, which is gorgeous - the windows are large, and shutters are painted a dusky pink colour, so when you do manage to have a lie-in, you are bathed in this warm morning light glow - proper rose-tinted life right there.  \n\nThere are no curtains, because of the shutters, but I haven't found this to be a problem in terms of light.",
                "Noise Level": "This room is NOT quiet. It is right opposite the front door, and the floor in the hall being wooden, you hear every footstep and voice echo. The porters' shoes clacking as they do their night time rounds will wake you if they come down the front stairs. Also, forget sleeping after the bedder arrives in the morning. \n\nAside from this, the wall between K4 and K5 is hideously thin. If you don't have music playing you can hear almost every word being said next door, which is a mixture of exasperating and embarrassing, as you really don't want to be eavesdropping on your neighbour, nor complaining, when they have the same problem as you do. \n\nI am a quite a light sleeper, and have had to wear ear plugs every night to sleep - and even then am woken up constantly.",
                "Worst Features": "The noise. Ensure that you are a very heavy sleeper before you pick this room. Also the cold.",

I have things to do most evenings so never eat in hall and it's a real problem; often have to queue for the kitchen. Microwave is crap, fridge is crap and tiny, toaster is crap, kitchen is generally pretty dirty and there's years and years of food lurking in all the corners which suggests it doesn't get cleaned very thoroughly. 7 people to one tiny kitchen means storage/fridge space is really limited.",

She's nice and well-meaning but ultimately having someone breathing down your neck is a real pain, and it's a big step backwards in terms of your sense of independence. On balance I wouldn't recommend living in 3 or 4 Mortimer Road for this reason alone. Her rules are pretty reasonable I guess, but they do mean that you're much more restricted: no parties (or even small gatherings), no cups on tables without coasters, etc etc. She has a go at you about tidiness and stuff but it's rather hypocritical as she doesn't clean our rooms very often or very thoroughly, and the shower's full of mould...",

Although there are 2 showers they are both in the same room with a lockable door, and only one of the showers has a curtain- basically you are sharing 1 shower with 8 people. Usually it's ok though and i've only had to wait for the shower a couple of times. There is also another room with a bath, though i've never used it.",

Also, some storage space above the cupboard which you can use to store things over the vacation, though it doesn't lock. 1 underbed box as well. The carpet has a large iron stain in the middle, and several other dark stains. Also has a (blocked up) fireplace with mantlepiece.",

The internet connection is next to the plugs in the corner of the room, so quite a good position for the desk (my 2m ethernet cable can just reach it). I don't think it's been redecorated in a while, and lots of the paint is peeling off behind the desk. \nDoesn't have a nice tree court view but you can see into st mikes court (though not down to the street as there is a large window ledge blocking the view). The mantlepiece above the fireplace is good for putting stuff on.\nOverall though i'd be happy to choose this room again, but if you have the option of getting a room on the tree court side then do as it should be quieter.",

                "Natural Lighting": "Not too bad, very sunny in the morning which is nice, but can be a bit dingy later in the day, so you have to have the light on most of the afternoon. Bring an extra lamp (they give you one for your desk but you may want another one too).",

                "Furniture": "bed, 1 chest of drawers, 1 table, 1 bookshelf or shoe rack (can't decide what it is), extra book racks on the wall, computer chair, 1 easy comfy chair, 2 coffee tables- one big and a small one, 1 cupboard AND SINK with a mirror plus light! Storage space on top of the cupboard. A FRIDGE!!!",
                "General": "Electrical plug points are not enough, bring extension cords. Being the only student on the floor helps to work alone in the room, but easy for friends to visit as there aren't as many stairs to climb (trust me, its a genuine problem with other rooms). the staircase and wooden doors are pretty. The door creepily creeks open if not locked properly. Great room for someone relatively low in the ballot. Feel free to have a look in case you can't decide, the reviews help a lot anyway. Giving an 8/10 as even though the room isn't that amazing, one could do much worse than this room in our college :)",
                "Gyp Room": "very private. lots of cupboards, a fridge, a microwave, kettle, Georgie, toaster etc. share it with two fellows, I think only one actually uses it. Tiny in size, but very standard (in terms of size) compared to the rest of tree court. Others share the same size among 4 students...",
                "Heating": "Good. the warmest room I have ever had. Lived in an amazing set in St. mikes in my first year and this room is way better. Maybe too hot for those who don't fancy tropical weather..?",
                "Natural Lighting": "Bad. So bad. A standing lamp is definitely required as the high ceiling can get really dark and gloomy at night/after 4-ish pm. A bit of sun in the morning, but seems to disappear behind the church after 10.30am!! Choose a different room if natural lighting is important. The ones facing the court are great!",
                "Noise Level": "Not too bad as long as the windows are shut...double glazed. Actually, it depends, didn't bother me much but the guy in the year before me clearly didn't have a good time trying to sleep/study",
                "Worst Features": "Cupboard space is virtually nothing. You just get half of a cupboard as the other half is the sink cabinet. The walls desperately need to be painted and natural lighting is not great.",

                "Best Features": "MIRROR! All the other rooms in Rose Cres only have a tiny one attached to the wall, whereas this room has an extra mirror. Sounds strange to guys, but girls will definitely appreciate it. The view over Rose Crescent is lovely, you can take your armchair and sit next to the window. If you put some flowers in the window-box it's very serene. The amount of furniture was good, especially when I compared this is my Harvey Court room. LOCATION - awesome. You only need a bike if you can't face the 5 minute walk to most places. Can't emphasize the benefits of this enough, especially when considering the library and hall.",
                "Furniture": "Chest of drawers, large wardrobe (compared to some I've seen!), bedside table, desk, three shelves above desk, strange computer stand with three shelves (used this for my crockery), full-length mirror unattached to the wall, swivel chair, two armchairs. Plenty of sockets.",
                "General": "I didn't live in this room for very long, which is such a shame. Apart from the noise I would say it's a great place to live. The furniture is a bit mismatched, but then again, this is standard for Caius. I moved around the wardrobe and drawers to make it a bit lighter in the rooms, and put up lots of posters and throws to put a bit of colour into the room. Yellow walls and navy carpet...perhaps I've been spoilt after Harvey Court...",
                "Gyp Room": "Two kitchens on this corridor, plenty enough  in terms of facilities and space. There are tiny cupboard and massive cupboards, so my advice would be to share the space (if you eat masses of food like me...). Fridge is tiny for 4/5 people, should really take the freezer compartment out. I found that annoying before Hall started at the beginning of term. Has a microwave and George Foreman.",

                "Worst Features": "Dark carpet (with strange stains - recommend a rug...), not much light (as with many rooms in Caius old Courts and Rose Cres), hideous curtains in my opion (Room 4 has nice curtains if you're into decor) and also there was a double glazing panel left on the floor which needs to be installed for the NOISE.",

                "Bathroom": "Again, probably the worst in the building. The showers themselves are actually really good (powerful and always warm), but the facilities in general aren\u00c2\u2019t. There have been far too many mornings when I\u00c2\u2019ve crawled to the bathroom only to be comforted by the smell of drains, which only makes matters worse. Sometimes the smell is vom-inducing even when you feel as fresh as a fresher on their first day. There are also awkward steps up to the showers, and the lighting is a bit weird. We\u00c2\u2019re only sharing 2 showers between 4 people (should be 5), so I\u00c2\u2019ve only actually used 1 shower for the term and a half I\u00c2\u2019ve lived here. No worries with that.",
                "Best Features": "The view: I would argue that it\u00c2\u2019s the best view in the whole of Rose Crescent, but I\u00c2\u2019m biased. From my desk I can see into Gardies, down to Trinity Street, and into quite a few shops. With the window open you can also catch bits of some very weird conversations. I would like to make it clear at this moment that I am not a stalker. I just happen to be unashamedly nosy. If you\u00c2\u2019re as weird as me then this is the perfect room for you. Storage space means you can bring as much as your parents/supportive friends can handle. Find a rower to help you move in (warning: you\u00c2\u2019ll have to listen to boatie chat, but this is outweighed by the amount of stuff you can get in). The location is probably the glory of this room: it\u00c2\u2019s easier to get to shops and restaurants from here than from about 97% of all the other rooms in Caius.",
                "Furniture": "If you like matching things then you probably won\u00c2\u2019t like this room. NOTHING matches. However, the storage space is great. There are 2 alcoves with big shelves, and I separate these into \u00c2\u2018things I use for work\u00c2\u2019, and \u00c2\u2018random things I bring with me for some unknown reason\u00c2\u2019. Bring lots of weird stuff to impress/confuse your friends. Big chest of draws and also a large cupboard with hanging space and shelves. Most people are convinced that the cupboard is haunted, as the door often opens on its own. Again, a talking point. There\u00c2\u2019s also a coffee table where I put other miscellaneous things, like packets of cereal and shoe polish. Desk isn\u00c2\u2019t massive, but it\u00c2\u2019s big enough considering all the other storage space. The comfy chair is one of the things that will improve your life when it\u00c2\u2019s week five, no one seems to like you, and you just want to eat chocolate. However, make sure that your best friends don\u00c2\u2019t always commandeer it and call it \u00c2\u2018my chair\u00c2\u2019: it\u00c2\u2019s your chair, not theirs. The bed is surprisingly comfortable, and there\u00c2\u2019s a bedside table. However, the dimensions of the room mean that there\u00c2\u2019s a weird gap down the side of the bed: as always, a place to dump all that random stuff that you don\u00c2\u2019t actually need.",
                "General": "History supervisors are always droning on about conclusions, so I\u00c2\u2019ll try to make this a good one. In summation, this room is basically like your favourite grandmother. It\u00c2\u2019s a bit tatty round the edges, nothing about it really works, it\u00c2\u2019s a weird shape, and it can sometimes be loud and creaky. However, it\u00c2\u2019s so endearing and gives so much joy that you can\u00c2\u2019t really stay angry at it for too long. I\u00c2\u2019m the least interior-design minded person I know, and even I\u00c2\u2019ve been able to make it feel quite nice. It\u00c2\u2019s definitely not perfect, but it\u00c2\u2019s a bit like Jasper in The Holiday before Kate Winslet finally rejects him: it\u00c2\u2019s very frustrating but somehow you can\u00c2\u2019t stop loving it. This room review is now almost the same length as my weekly essay, so congratulations for getting to the end. P.S. This room will always love me more than it loves you.",
                "Gyp Room": "Standard Caius kitchen. Positive features: it\u00c2\u2019s directly opposite the room, meaning that water and carbs are easily accessible after a night out. It\u00c2\u2019s also good in terms of storage space (5 people share a kitchen, but only 4 in our case). Negatives features: it\u00c2\u2019s the smallest kitchen in the building, the surfaces are really small and weirdly shaped, everything\u00c2\u2019s made of metal, and as always there\u00c2\u2019s only a microwave oven, a toaster, a kettle, and a George Foreman. I\u00c2\u2019ve managed to bake cakes, pasta bakes, and casseroles in the kitchen without too much hassle, but it\u00c2\u2019s not great. However, there are enough food shops in stumbling distance not to have to worry about it too much. College is also close, and you can use the free money on your card there instead.",
                "Heating": "The heating in my room is great. When I first moved in I was very suspicious of the radiator. It\u00c2\u2019s not big enough to hang a towel on and is directly under the window. However, I\u00c2\u2019ve only turned on the radiator on about 10 occasions (including the week when we had snow), and I\u00c2\u2019m hardly ever cold. This isn\u00c2\u2019t really surprising seeing as the room is pretty much bang in the middle of the crescent and has stuff going on above and below it. Heating: good.",
                "Natural Lighting": "Not great \u00c2\u2013 from my (quite large) window I can see a fairly limited section of sky. Most of the rooms in Rose Crescent aren\u00c2\u2019t great in terms of natural light, but luckily my room has a great lamp. Extra lights are a must \u00c2\u2013 I had to bring an extra lamp for my desk in fear of developing the eyesight of a newly born mole rat. To avoid a similar fate, get one before you figure out that natural light is a problem.",
                "Noise Level": "After finding the noise quite annoying when I first moved in, I\u00c2\u2019ve pretty much stopped noticing it. However, this might be because I have the ability to sleep at the same time as having entire conversations with my friends and then completely forgetting them. Most of the time there\u00c2\u2019s more of a buzz than anything. It can be annoying when La Raza have big nights (Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, sometimes Wednesdays), but that\u00c2\u2019s more to do with the drunk people outside (also a problem with Gardies and McDonald\u00c2\u2019s) than the music. In fact, many of my evenings working have been greatly improved by singing along to Bob Marley and songs that would otherwise only be heard on Heart\u00c2\u2019s Club Classics. Warning: the playlist is pretty much the same every night. Basically, don\u00c2\u2019t live here if you can\u00c2\u2019t deal with noise. If you can deal with a bit of noise then live on the second floor instead.",
                "Worst Features": "The noise: the drunken shouting; the fact that when the friend that lives above you has people over and they decide to jump up and down you can hear everything; the fact that the walls are very thin and not much is left to the imagination. There\u00c2\u2019s also a very dubious creamy stain on the carpet, which I try to ignore. Facilities aren\u00c2\u2019t great, and you can probably find better elsewhere, but it\u00c2\u2019s not too bad.",

                "Best Features": "It's larger than many of the other rooms in tree court, and is really a great room that surprisingly doesn't seem to go too early in the ballot. It's got great views over tree court, it's quiet, it's got a sink, and you can also get good lapwing wifi so there's no need to worry about going over the usage limit and faffing about with bloody ethernet cables. Another great feature is the ENTIRE WALL PIN BOARD. Basically the biggest wall is covered in cream-painted pin board almost ceiling-to-floor. There are picture hooks too that can be hung from the picture rail that runs pretty much around the whole room. HUGE built in cupboard in the corner of the room is very useful for storing things in over vac if you have to clear out. I've never asked to see what's become of the key for it, but so long as you don't leave anything mega valuable in it then it means you can fill it up and don't have to worry about parents driving back at the beginning and end of every term.",

Lots of shelf space and you can move / adjust / add more shelves to what's there because they're just planks on movable brackets on one wall.",
                "General": "Few sockets - plug extension an essential. Location is great for town and close enough to Sedgwick and other faculties. Bang next to the library & Sainsbury's & MacDonald's etc that you will feel the chubby luxury of potentially never having to move more than four hundred yards for anything. One of the things I heard against living in college was people saying they didn't like to be monitored all the time by the porters. This REALLY isn't a thing, or a problem; you can get away with not signing guests in all the time (and any time of night), and unless you do something particularly embarrassing or have some previous beef with them, then they're generally fine.",

It's VERY small, I don't think any of us have tried negotiating how to use the George Foreman as it has to sit on the window-sill over the sink , and the microwave also hangs over the sink, and it's all a bit tricky and not entirely electricity-safety-friendly. The fridge in there is also very small, and shared by two of the rooms (I think), but this room has its own fridge.",
                "Heating": "Excellent. Room warms up quickly and the college heating is pretty much unlimited. Although I have noticed that the radiator turns off after about 1am, which can be annoying if you like to work at night / come back late after going out.",
                "Natural Lighting": "Good-ish - large windows facing west, lovely sunsets in the evenings. The main light bulb is pretty rubbish and dreary as hell, so I brought a couple of small lamps from home. Would advise doing this.",
                "Noise Level": "Very little. Street noise is a minimum as the windows look out over the court. The worst you'll get are the bells on Sunday which can be loud-ish and the occasional drunken roarings drifting over from Senate House Passage. Very nice thing is that when it's warm and the windows are open you can hear the choir practising in the chapel in the evening. Very dreaming spires.",
                "Worst Features": "It's quite expensive, especially if you get 39 week rental in which case student loan won't cover it at all. Still, most of the rooms in the middle of town are ludicrously expensive so you'll have to suck it up one way or another.",

Never usually a problem in terms of having to wait, and that was even with one shower out of action. The shower that worked was generally very good (powerful, good hot water supply), though the floor space often floods (there's no door - only a shower curtain) and given that there are no hooks to hang towels, this gets fairly annoying... If you want a bath, you can go to the one in Q which is pretty decent.",
                "Best Features": "The dining table is lovely and great for socialising - try and get some extra chairs for it if you can. The room is a great size, it has a lovely view and lovely sunsets. It's a brilliant location and, all things considered, I'd say it was probably the nicest of this staircase (for example it has a better wardrobe than R16 opposite). There's a picture rail which is great for hanging pictures from the Caius picture scheme - otherwise you'll need to do something with the pinboardwall.",
                "Furniture": "Two bookshelves on the wall, a self-standing set of shelves, a coffee table, an armchair, a dining table and one chair, bed, wardrobe, desk, desk chair, desk lamp, bedside table, full length mirror",
                "General": "Make sure you bring lots of things to decorate, it needs it. The walls and ceiling are horribly scabby but it's nothing some posters and fairy lights can't fix! The wardrobe has cupboards above that can be used to keep things in over the holidays if you haven't got vacres which is really handy. Overall, a great room.",
                "Gyp Room": "Shared with 3, though the fridge (woefully small) is shared between 2 because R16 has its own. Gyp room is tiny and fairly gross in most respects but at the end of the day it's adequate for tea and microwave meals! To be honest, you get used to it pretty quickly. The microwave, kettle and toaster all work well. I've yet to use the George Foreman...",
                "Heating": "Generally pretty good, I'd say. Blankets never go amiss though",
                "Natural Lighting": "Streams through in the morning which is lovely when it's sunny, but it does get very dingy as soon as you hit mid- afternoon: definitely invest in extra lighting (beside lamp etc). One of the great features about the top of this staircase is that there are absolutely beautiful sunsets most nights",
                "Noise Level": "Not much, because it faces Tree Court. Sound travels on the staircase, so you're more likely to be woken by neighbours than anything else.",
                "Worst Features": "Very in need of redecorating, the lack of sink I guess (though it's not exactly a disaster) and the lack of plug sockets - you'll need to bring an extension. The bedside table has a horrible stain on it that might want to be covered by a coaster or something",

Two showers shared between all eight people in the staircase are two floors down and have just been renovated badly. (One shower loses pressure if you tell it to go colder and the other has a curtain that doesn't make it all the way across the door.) No bath.

Overhead light and desk light provided.\nNo sink. Also has a above-head-height cupboard that can be used for holiday storage.",

Four wall sockets, but all on one side of the room (two by the window, two hidden under the bed) so bring extension cables.

There's no sink in the room (it's the small half of an old set) so this is the sink you will use.\n\nThere is a bathroom 2 floors down, which has the floor space of the toilet and T14 combined. It contains a bath, toilet, sink and large shower cubicle containing 2 showers in the same mini room. You get to choose which one to use! Yay!\n\nThis bathroom is shared between everyone on the staircase, which is only actually 6 students (4 on top floor, 2 on the floor below. The rest are fellows who never use the showers. Tut tut.)\n\nWhen you go out the room you can hear whether the shower is on, saving you a trip. Most of the time it is free for me, but it is frustrating when members of a certain gender (you know which one I mean) take forever in there. However, I'm the only non arts student (they get up late), non rower (they get up early) so I often can get straight in.",
                "Best Features": "Ok-ish view, you can see St John's chapel and Trinity Clock, as well as a Trinity rooftop fire escape. Living in college! Storage space.",
                "Furniture": "The room has a bed, office chair, green armchair, bin, desk with 3 drawers, small bedside table, large coffee table (I don't however drink coffee so I used this for glasses of water instead), built in chest of drawers, double cupboard with built in cubby holes, and over cupboard storage spaces, more than enough storage space.\n\nThere's also an alcove above the chest of drawers with a mirror and light. The light has a shaver port too.\n\nThe cupboard really is great, I've got a compartment hanger thing in there as well, without which there's over 2ft of coat hanger space. Bring your own coat hangers, there's none provided.\n\nThe bed is comfy enough, no complaints here. The curtains do an adequate job of blocking out the light.\n\nThe wall by the door consists of corkboard, and shelves. However, the shelves aren't screwed on to the supports so take care here.",
                "General": "The room is on the top floor, but as I have long legs the many stairs are no challenge at all.\n\nLiving in college! It rocks. You save 25 minutes a day in walking time over a Mortimer Roader/Harvey Courter. And that's just for hall. You have basically no commuting time for Hall, Pigeon hole visiting, supervisions, Porter visits. The way your door works makes it impossible to lock yourself out. You can occasionally forget to lock your door, but if you are a top chap like I this is not going to happen.\n\nBike storage is in St Mikes, where there are enough racks, what with the new ones they've put in. There's also an underground bike storage area.\n\nSockets - There are 2 by the bed, bring an extension cable for all your electrical things. There are also 2 on the other side between the cupboards and the door but I rarely use these.\n\nYou always hear the rumors of the College wanting to remove the George Foreman grills on safety grounds, so this might have been abducted in the dead of night, never to bee seen or grill again. Guard your grill. Guard it with your life. Because they're quite good. Some gyp rooms in Tree court have been refurbished, with new cupboards and sinks, but no grill. This might happen over the summer to T staircase top floor.\n\n\nI might sound quite negative in this review, but all my complaints are overruled by being in College. If you get the choice between this room and a Mortimer Road one twice the size, I'd recommend going for this.",
                "Gyp Room": "Absolute comedy gold. If you've come from Harvey court with any size of their gyp rooms, take a visit here after you've balloted to reassess what a kitchen could possibly look like.\nIt's really small. Only big enough for one person, as you have to leave the gyp room to swap around. It's being redecorated on Monday, which is nice as the paint was a bit chipped.\n\nThe gyp room contains a toaster, kettle, combination microwave and George Foreman (although again the person who installed the microwave above the George Foreman must have been out of their minds as the grill can't open fully, which makes putting food in a 3 hand job. Ludicrous.). There's also a small fridge, but I think T13 and T16 have their own although their food occasionally shows up in this fridge. The fridge has a small freezer compartment but this has become frosted and an ice cream I put in there melted.\n\nThere's hobs too, but they're deactivated (when you see where they are you'll understand why). \n\nThere is minimal cupboard space, 4 small ones below the hobs and 2 shelves above. I keep my stuff in 2 of the cupboards below, and others use the shelves.\n\nThe gyp room is shared between 4, but to be fair I rarely encounter other people when using it, so don't imagine it'll always be a fight for the microwave.",
                "Heating": "Fine for me. There is a radiator under the window, with an adjustable thermostat on it. The heating has always been on for me so far (Written at the start of March) unlike other locations in college where it's turned off at times.\n\nThere's a small draft from somewhere and another under the door, but these don't really bother me.",
                "Natural Lighting": "Pretty poor. The room is north facing so no direct sunlight, but as I sit here and type I realise that plenty of light does get in. However, come night time, it is dark. The main light bulb is of the energy saving variety. It saves so much energy that it probably doesn't emit light but absorbs it. (Slight exaggeration there.) \nThere's a small lamp above the mirror in the alcove, which does a good enough job there but can't be relied on to light the room.\nThere's a small lamp that was on my desk when I arrived but again isn't bright enough, so I use that as a bedside lamp as it is nice and dim. \n\nWhen I arrived at the start of Michaelmas, I went to Homebase and got a great cheap uplighter/spotlight combo, which I use by my desk. This does an incredible job of lighting the room, and I suggest you factor this trip into your moving in schedule.",
                "Noise Level": "Pretty noisy. Most mornings Trinity college has vans reversing up (With that now oh-so familiar beeping) to their gate. I've got quite used to it though. Also, as mentioned by previous occupants drunk people late at night can be pretty loud. Also, the fact that the walls are pretty thin and door having a 2cm gap at the bottom (the person who installed the door must have been drunk at the time) combine to make it really easy to hear your neighbours. Great if you want to chat through the walls (No-one has ever done this) but not so great if your neighbours are party \"animals\" who likes inviting friends around late on saturday/any night.\n\nSometimes you get air whistling through the windows as they're not quite airtight, and occasionally they vibrate loudly.",

The wardrobe isn't full size, so on the hanging rail inside it, suits & shirts etc can't be hung properly.\n\nBut a lovely room: I like the fireplace (blocked but still a nice feature) and the view onto Tree Court.",

                "Best Features": "Really nice to have separate space for work/sleep. The bedder is very nice and smiley and not at all intrusive. Good view of Caius and King's Chapel from bay window. Lots of space. Fridge in room is handy.",
                "Furniture": "Sitting room: nice old-fashioned wooden desk in bay window, desk lamp, swivelly desk chair in hideous shade of orange (I cover it with a rug, sorted), wooden bookshelf with adjustable shelves, wooden coffee table, comfy chair, medium-sized fridge. Also, very nice old fireplace (boarded up with electric radiator in front) with painted Caius crest and mantelpiece. Handy to put things on and nice and decorative.\nBedroom: fairly comfortable bed, another fireplace with mantelpiece and unpainted crest as headboard for bed, small wooden bedside table, big wooden chest of drawers, fairly little inbuilt wardrobe but plenty big enough, little medicine cabinet next to basin, little mirror above basin. Also in the little entrance bit (small square space between bedroom door and sitting room door) there are three handy hooks to hang up coats etc. You can also put your bins here and shut your bedroom door if you want a lie-in without the bedder coming into your bedroom in the morning.",
                "General": "Two sockets in each room so you really need at least one multi-plug adaptor. Can be a bit chilly at desk occasionally as bay window not double glazed. Although this room is really nice and I love living here, I did spend a bit of money on adding things like rugs on the floor to brighten it up, and I bought a folding deck-cahir and covered it in a rug as an extra seat, because otherwise there's nowhere for a friend to sit if you have guests. You might want to do something similar. Basically, this room could do with a bit more furniture but don't let that put you off! Beautiul view, nice and private because you're at the top of the stairs. Great if a friend takes D10 (opposite/next door), because then it's a bit like sharing a flat - it's just D10 and D11 on the top floor.",
                "Gyp Room": "Tiny gyp-room next door. The person opposite has their own mini-gyp in their room so the one next door is basically yours, although you'll have to share the kitchen sink in there with them - their gyp doesn't have a sink. Your gyp-room has a combi microwave, a George Foreman grill, a toaster and a kettle. Also reasonably big cupboards and drawerrs to store your food and crockery. No fridge as it's way too small in there, but that does mean you get a fridge in your room, hooray!",
                "Heating": "Electric heater in sitting room is quite powerful so you'll be nice and warm while you're working. The radiator in the bedroom is quite good too, although it turns off at midnight ish and is back on in the morning. You can turn on the electric one at any time.",

However, the bedroom windows are double glazed so it's really not bad at all. I use earplugs on those nights or put some quiet music on so it's fine. Noise in the sitting room is fine really.",
                "Worst Features": "Noise from Rose Crescent in bedroom sometimes. Tiny gyp-room - to have room to chop properly I got a big wooden chopping board from Sainsbury's to put across the sink as a work surface. It's a bit annoying but you get used to it. Worth it for how nice the room is though. Also, unlike in room opposite there is no full-length mirror so I leant one from a charity shop against the wall in the sitting room. Bring one if you're vain like me! Also you're at the top of four flights of stairs, so moving in/out can be a bit of a pain.",

There are also coat hooks. \n\nIn the little entrance hall there are further coathooks.\n\nIn the bedroom there is quite a small fitted wardrobe, with another cupboard above it (it still has plenty of hanging space for various dresses, skirts, trousers, shirts and gown so it isn't tiny), a chest of draws, a sink, a bathroom cabinet, a bedside cabinet, a bed and a fireplace to be used as a headboard.

The walls also are beige and the doors grey. Nice sloping ceiling in the bedroom makes it quite cosy.  \n\nCan get quite chilly, but have good radiator in the bedroom.

Obviously the bells from St Marys can also be heard, but again you soon adapt so you don't hear them any more.
