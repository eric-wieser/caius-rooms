	<p>If you are an overseas student you have the option to choose a room in L St Maryâ€™s or 37 Green Street. The advantages of this are that you are guaranteed a room in town and can use the room over Christmas and Easter. If you would prefer to ballot with your non-overseas friends instead that is also fine. You can still apply for continuous accommodation in Michaelmas next year and it will be available in all locations (excluding Harvey Court and 3 and 4 Morti).</p>
