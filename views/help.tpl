	<h1>Before the ballot</h1>

	<h2>Check you are registered in the upcoming ballot</h2>
	<p>When you login, <em>check you are in ballot</em>. If a ballot is running, you will see a banner across all pages of the site, telling you whether you are in a a ballot, and what time your slot is. If there is a problem, this banner will tell you about it.</p>
	<p>If there is a problem with this information, please contact the Accommodation Office immediately, by emailing <a href="mailto:accommodation@cai.cam.ac.uk">accommodation@cai.cam.ac.uk</a>.</p>
	<p>If you do not see any banner, and believe there to be a ballot in progress, then you might need to view this webpage on a larger screen.</p>

	<h2>Browse room, photos, reviews and prices</h2>
	<p>Navigating the site should be fairly straightforward. Start by looking around places to live in college.</p>


	<h1>Balloting</h1>

	<h2>Before your slot opens</h2>
	<p>You can see which rooms are taken by other students who ballot before you. It is wise to keep an eye on the balloting website leading up to your ballot slot in case your preferred rooms are taken.</p>

	<h2>When your slot opens</h2>
	<p>At your allocated ballot time you will then be able to ballot for a room. Your ballot slot will remain open until you have selected a room, but remember other people’s slots will open too at their allocated times (typically every few minutes), so it is wise to have a shortlist of rooms prepared and to ballot relatively quickly.</p>
	<p>To ballot:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Go to the page of your selected room</li>
		<li>Click the “Reserve this room” button near the top of the page</li>
		<li>Confirm your selection in the pop-out window</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Confirming your room choice is <em>final</em> and room swaps cannot be made later, so ensure you are happy with the room and are aware of its cost.

	<h2>After balloting</h2>
	<p>You are now done!</p>
	<p>You will receive an online accommodation licence agreement for the Accommodation Office in due course, probably soon after moving in to your new room at the start of the following academic year.</p>
	<p>Please remember to add photos and a review of <a href="/rooms/mine">your room</a> to this website before the next year’s ballot!</p>
